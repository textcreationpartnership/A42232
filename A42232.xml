            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

The Author, born in a low Countrey, hath, by his excellent works, both Divine and Humane, raised himself to the just Repute of the most General, and the wisest Scholar of his time; So that, it is become a character of an Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Student (as it was said, in the last Age, of his Country-man, the Great <hi>Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus)</hi> to be well versed in the Books of <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius.</hi> Out of whose Magazine, our best English Writers, to their praise, have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed some of their best furniture. The Argument of this Work is worthy the study of Princes, and Great Persons; From whom, certainly, God expects a greater care of his
<pb facs="tcp:34728:4"/> Churches Peace and Order. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, the Grave Author hath here said, some things first of all; some, with a better Grace than any other; and some, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have been said very well by our own Men, yet perhaps will be better taken (as the English humour is) from the Pen of a stranger. The Translator's Designe is, partly publick, in this scribling Age (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet, we have need of more good Books, to Out the many bad ones) to cast in his Mite into the Treasury of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> (whom, as the Moderate Author much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, so He professeth himself to be one of her poor Children:) partly private, by this Dedication of it with Himself to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, to leave a Gratefull Monument (and a lasting Monument, he hopes) in those Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hands, that have supported him, in his worst and weakest Times. May Your Honours Both live to see the Publick Breaches, both of Church and State, fairly made up; and particularly, the Ruines of your <hi>Sudely:</hi> And, may Your illustrious Names and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues live after you, and be increased in your Children.

                     <p>The other reason is, from the nature and <note place="margin">13.

                        <hi>the City may more easily be built without ground, than the Citizens preserv'd without a persuasion of the deity.

Even false Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces somewhat to outward peace; and the nearer it comes to truth, the more it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails to that end; but for Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (to let passe the testimonies of her friends) the adversaries have given it this praise, <hi>That it binds men with a holy tye, not to commit stealth or robbery, not to break their word, or faile in their trust,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks; <hi>That it teacheth nothing but what is just and gentle,</hi> as <hi>Ammianus Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus; that it is a persuasion which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyes all wickednesse,</hi> as it is in <hi>Zosimus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nor is this the effect of Religion, in that part only, where it prescribes a rule for manners, and strengthens it with threats and promises: the Doctrines and Rites al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so have no small moment to the furthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of good life, and advancing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick happinesse. <hi>Xenophon</hi> perhaps thought it was a witty conceit when he said, T'was

Kings and Emperours have learned this at their cost, and the Annals are full of examples. One thing more for conclusion; the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of all ages tels us, that change in Religion, even in Rites and Ceremonies, if it be not with consent, or manifestly for the better, often shakes the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and brings it into danger.

What admirers the Jewes were of their Priests, even in this appears, that after their return from the Captivity, they forth-with added to the Priesthood the Principality, which quickly advanced to a Kingdome, and so to a Tyranny.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is worth our observation, that, after the Institution of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, some reliques of the antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome still remained. For, to the Fathers of families was left, the killing of the Passeover; wherein, as the Jewes rightly note, they performed somewhat of the Priests office. Circumcision also was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred without a Priest, as all the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews consent, by any one that had skill to do it. And this is not to be omitted, that Prophecy, which seems to have a naturall coherence with the Priesthood, was as well given to Kings as Priests; Yea, to private men, more often than to the Priests. Thus did God, many wayes, bring the people to an acknowledgement of the weaknesse of the Leviticall order. Thus did the Law, as it were, by the hand lead them unto Christ; who was to be the highest Prophet, the highest Priest, and the highest King; who also should make all believers in him par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of that threefold honour.

So also, the Kingdome of Christ, which partly consists in his divine care of his Church against her enemies, partly in a spirituall government of the hearts of men, hath not taken away either the right, or the name of Kings, whose Empire is externall, and subject both to the divine providence, and the spirituall actions of Christ: according to that of <hi>Sedulius:</hi>

                        <l>Who gives to His an heavenly Crown.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>The name of Priests is also given to the preachers of the New Testament in a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner: but, there was some reason, why Christ and his Apostles did alwaies
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34728:18"/> abstain from that kind of speech; which ought to admonish us, that we do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly and promiscuously argue, from the Leviticall order, to the Evangelicall; seeing, there is a wide difference, both in the office, and the designing of the persons to it.</p>
                     <p>It is enquired therefore, under the <note place="margin">6. And by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Law.</note> Christian Law, whether the Highest Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Pastoral office (which may be also call'd the Priesthood, as was noted before) can rightly be united in the same person. Many arguments are brought to prove they cannot, but all are not of the same strength; for some doe more rightly prove the offices to be divers, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have been; and, that Pastors, as Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, have no Empire; rather than the conjunction of the offices to be interdicted. That is of more efficacy, that the Apostle forbids the <hi>souldier of Christ</hi> (he seems to <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 11. 4.</note> speak of the Pastorall warfare) <hi>to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with worldly businesse;</hi> which the most ancient Canons, intitled Apostolicall, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 6. 81. 83.</note> extend even to inferiour civill offices. And lest any think this only constituted for the times, they lived under heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; the same is repeated, in the Synod of <hi>Carthage,</hi> under <hi>Honorius</hi> and <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi>

                        <pb n="26" facs="tcp:34728:19"/> the Pastorall office is of such weight and difficulty, that it requires the whole man. Although this must not be taken so rigidly, as alwayes to exclude Pastors from under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking any secular charge (the Lawes, for example, except Tuition:) yet it sufficeth <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Novel.</hi> 123 <hi>Cap.</hi> 5.</note> to remove from the Pastor any charge, that is difficult and perpetuall; as we see the Apostles exempted themselves, for the same reason, from the care of the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes maintenance; an office otherwise not improper for them. But the charge of a Kingdome, is both perpetuall, and more weighty, than any other. The strongest argument is, That the royall office requires far other manners and behaviour, than the Pastorall, as it is described in the Gospell; So that, even thence it sufficiently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, both cannot with any convenience and comlinesse be sustained by one, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inconstant levity in passing from the exercise of one to the other.</p>
                     <p>We have shewed that the Empire is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the sacred Function; and, that there are causes, why Both together ought not to be undertaken by the same person. Neverthelesse, because both the Empire, and the Pastorall office (by Pastors I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Ministers of the Gospel; for Kings are Pastors too, and that of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:34728:19"/> Lords flock; yea, Pastors of the Pastors, as a Bishop once call'd King <hi>Edgar)</hi> though distinct, yet agree in this, that the same, which is the Pastors only care, is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall care of the Highest Powers; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Divine things may be rightly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and the Salvation of men procured; we need not wonder, if the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <note place="margin">7. Sacred names &amp; Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges given to the Highest Powers.</note> for the community of the matter, and the end, receive sometimes the title of the other Function. Hence it was, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> call'd himselfe a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and other Emperours had the title of Renowned Pontifs or Priests. In the Emperour <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus</hi> the Roman Bishop extolls <hi>his Priestly mind, and Apostolicall affection:</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> mentions the Apostolicall cares of <hi>Theodosius.</hi> As the names, so the privilege of the Function, hath been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Emperours. The sixt generall Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod forbiddeth Laicks to approach the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Table of the Lord; but the Emperour is excepted. Upon which place, <hi>Balsamo</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> observes, how the Emperours were wont to Seale with Wax, as the Bishops of that time did, and to instruct the people in Religion.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Emperours were called, as we have shewed they were, Bishops and Pontifs and Priests, there was then no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34728:20"/> cause of upbraiding some English writers for attributing to their King a certaine <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall</hi> power, seeing the name is often imposed not from the manner of working, but from the matter, as we call the Laws <hi>military, nauticall, rurall.</hi> Wherefore the Kings power is also spirituall, as it is conversant about Religion, which is a spirituall thing.</p>

For, <hi>naturall,</hi> in this argument, is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, not to Supernaturall, but to <hi>Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> So, when as it is certaine, God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, are one true God; that the same God be worshipped, is a point of naturall Law. Actions of the latter sort, that is, determined or defin'd by divine Positive Law, are such as were prescrib'd by God, some to all men, some to one people, some to single persons,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:34728:21"/> namely, to <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses,</hi>

Among all people, to <hi>Israel</hi> alone, God prescribed many Positive Lawes, pertaining to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and other things. To all mankind, some things were commanded for a time; as, the Law of the Sabbath, presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Creation, as some think; the Law of not eating bloud, or the strangled, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the floud: Other things to last for ever, as the Institutions of Christ, concerning Excommunication, Baptisme, the Supper, and if there be any more of that kind.</p>

For <hi>Aristotle</hi> describes that which is <hi>legally just to be that which from the beginning was indifferent, thus or thus; but, after the Law made, ceaseth to be so.</hi> And this is true, if we only look upon such an act of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, which intrinsecally changeth the action; for, when as the things that ought to be done, and the things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, are determined, and therefore immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as to morall good or evill, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that indefinite actions are left, as the only matter of such a change. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:34728:22"/> when the things that ought to be done, and those that ought not, are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a change extrinsecall, and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it from humane Authority, it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, they are Subject to the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, unlesse they be actions meerely internall. Hither it perteins, to assigne the time, place, manner, and persons, for performing of due actions, so far as the circumstances are undefin'd by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing, and the Law of God; also, to take away impediments, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to adde rewards; and, to restraine unlawfull actions, by such punishments as are in the Rulers power; or else, to inflict no punishments, which is call'd permis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the fact, and is sometimes no fault. To him that looks more narrowly into these things it will appeare, that by humane command, there ariseth a new Obligation, even in Conscience, though of lesse degree, in the things which men were before bound to doe, or leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. For the divine Law of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, saying to the Jew, <hi>Thou shalt not kill, Thou shall not steale,</hi> and the rest, not only declar'd, what was of the Law na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall; but, by the precept, added a new Obligation to the former; so that the Jew, doing the contrary, not only offended,

                        <hi>Law he dishonoureth God,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks.

                     <p>We have considered, how largely the matter under Humane Power is extended, and what acts belong unto it, in every kind: now, let us see what acts are not, by right, within the Command thereof. It <note place="margin">5. Acts not under Humane Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are only those that are repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Divine Law.</note> is certaine, those only are without the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Supreme Power, which are repugnant either to the Naturall, or to any other Divine Law; no other way, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the right of the Highest Power, can possibly be invented. The things defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Law Divine (wherein I compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the Naturall) are of two sorts; some commanded, some forbidden. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there are two acts of Empire, which belong not to the Right of him that Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth; <hi>To command what God forbids: To forbid what God commands.</hi> The reason is, because, as in naturall causes, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour have no force to work, against the Efficacy of the Superiour; so it is in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:34728:23"/> Wherefore such Commands, so far as they doe contradict the Divine, cannot have the proper effect of Commands; they cannot Impose an Obligation. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently saith <hi>Austin: If the Curator Commands somewhat, is it not to be done? no; If the Proconsul forbids. Herein you contemn not the Power, but choose to obey the Higher. Againe, if the Proconsul bid one thing, the Emperour appoint the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, without doubt you must hearken to the Emperour. Therefore, if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour doe require one thing, and God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what is to be done? God is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Power; Give us leave, O Emperour, to obey Him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet, we must carefully distinguish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Act of Authority, which moves the Subject to work; and the Force offered, <note place="margin">6. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands repugnant to Divine Law bind to a non—resistance, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</note> which imposes, on the Subject, a necessity of suffring. For, when the Act of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is without effect, and layes no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet the Force hath an effect, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Physicall, but Morall; not on the agents part, but the patients; namely, that it is not lawfull, to repell that force, by force: for violent defence, being lawfull against an Equal, against a Superiour is unlawfull.</p>

For Christ, when he said, <hi>Hee that taketh the Sword, shall perish by the sword,</hi> plainly disallows a forcible defence against the most unjust force offer'd by Authority. And hither is to be referr'd that of <hi>Paul, Hee that resisteth, resisteth the ordinance of God.</hi> There are two wayes of resisting, either by doing against the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, or by repelling force with force, as <hi>Austin</hi> interprets: <hi>Whether the Power, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring</hi>

                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 17, 20.</note> of gold and silver, and a multitude of horses) but because, doing so, no man might lawfully oppose force against Him: as the Romans say, <hi>The Praetor gives</hi>

                        <hi>Judgement,</hi> even when he decrees that which is unjust.

For, <hi>Peter</hi> teaching obedience to the King (that is, to the Highest Power) as Supreme, to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours (that is, to Inferiour Powers) as sent, and ordained by Him, manifestly shewes, all the right of Inferiour Powers to depend
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:34728:24"/> upon the Commission they receive from the Highest. Hence <hi>Austin</hi> concerning <hi>Pontius Pilat: Such power God had given him, that was contained under</hi> Caesar<hi>'s Power.</hi> And, was not <hi>David</hi> a Prince, and a Leader among the people of God, who was so farre from touching that Tyrants person, that his heart smote him, for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 7.</note> off the lap of his garment? Reason confirmes what we have said. For, those Magistrates, in respect of their Inferiours, are Magistrates, as long as it pleaseth the Supreme Power; but, in respect of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power, they are but private men; because all Power, and all Jurisdiction flowes from the Supreme, and still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon it. Hence <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> that most wise Emperour, said, <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates judge Private men, Princes the Magistrates, and God the Princes.</hi> By the name of Princes understanding the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, who were now become absolute. The ancient Christendome was of the same judgement; for no Governours, no Leaders of legions, ever attempted any thing with Arms, against the most impious, cruell, and bloudy Emperours: So that, it is a very sad thing, that our Age hath brought forth men of learning, who by a new-coyned doctrine, have opened a broad
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:34728:25"/> way for Seditions, and Wars to enter in. <note place="margin">8. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples alle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged to the contrary answered.</note> Neither ought we to be moved by any late examples of Arms taken up against Kings. For if they were taken up against Kings, upon whom the whole Right of the people was translated; and, who therefore raign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by a precarious, but proper Right; whatsoever pretext or successe they had, they cannot be prais'd without impiety. But, if any where Kings were bound by Contracts, or Positive Lawes, and Decrees of some Senate or States; against these, having not the highest Authority, upon just causes, by the judgement of the same Senate or States, Arms might be taken up. For many Kings, even such as succeed by inheritance, are Kings by name, rather than by Power; as <hi>Aemilius Probus</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of the Laconians. But, this deceives the unskilfull, that they doe not enough discern the daily administration of affaires obvious to their eyes, which in an Optima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is oft committed unto one; from the interiour Constitution of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. What I have said of Kings, I would have to be understood much more of them, who both really, and in title, were not Kings, but Princes; that is, not <hi>chiefest,</hi> but <hi>first.</hi> Whose Principality much differs from Supremacy. And again,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:34728:25"/> this is to be noted, that some Lords and Cities have Supreme Authority, though they seeme not to have it, being under the Trust and protection of another. But, seeing to be under protection, is not to be in subjection; and, as the Roman Lawyers note, <hi>The people ceaseth not to be free, that are fairly observant to anothers Majesty;</hi> these also may be endowed with Supreme Authority, who are obliged to another by unequall League, or tye of Homage. All this I set down to that end, lest any one hereafter (as I see hath been often done) defame good causes, by an ill Defence. I would more enlarge in this Argument (for 'tis of great consequence, and here to erre is dangerous) but that 'tis done already with great care by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, and of late by the learned <hi>Arnisaeus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon these premises, let us come to demonstrate the parity of Empire over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <note place="margin">9. The difference 'twixt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</note> and other matters. As in all things, the thoughts are not so easily ruled, as the words: so particularly, in Religion, <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath truly said; <hi>Who shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force me, either to believe, what I will not; or, not to believe, what I will?</hi> And in this sense that of <hi>Casiodor</hi> is true, <hi>Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Commanded;</hi> and of <hi>Bernard, Faith</hi>

                        <hi>is</hi> to <hi>be planted by persuasion, not obtruded by violence.</hi> Wherefore also the Emperours <hi>Gratian, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> said concerning an Heretick, <hi>Let him think, if he will, what is hurtfull for himself; let him not utter it, to the hurt of others.</hi> And, I suppose, <hi>Constantine</hi> had respect here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, when he call'd himself a Bishop or Overseer of <hi>things without:</hi> because, the inward acts, taken by themselves, are not the matter of Humane power; but are Subject to the power of God; who, by Bishops, not <hi>Commanding</hi> but <hi>Ministring,</hi> moves the minds of men with voices and signs; yet so, that he still reserves the maine Efficacy to himself alone. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, inward acts of all sorts, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken joyntly with the outward, fall under Humane Authority. The <hi>Cornelian</hi> Law lays hold on him, who carrys a weapon, with purpose to kill a man: and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour saith, <hi>not only the event in evill deeds, but the will is to be consider'd.</hi> So in <hi>Justinians Code, concerning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Faith,</hi> a Title is extant, to wit, for the Profession of Faith, which the first Law explains, <hi>All people under our Empire we require to be of such Religion,</hi> &amp;c. Hence came those names of Kings, <hi>Rectors, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, Defenders of the Faith.</hi> So also of

The cause is exprest, <hi>For they feared God:</hi> who by the dictate of Nature forbids to slay the innocent. King <hi>Ahab</hi> would have <hi>Naboth</hi> sell him his Vineyard; <hi>Naboth</hi> denyes: for, the Divine Law, given to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> forbad inheritances to be alienated from the same family. <hi>Antoninus Caracal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> commands <hi>Papinian</hi> the Lawyer, to defend the paricide committed by him: <hi>Papinian</hi> refuses, and had rather dye; because he knew, it was against the Law of Nature and Nations, to speak false and Patronize so great a crime. By the same right, but with more holy affection, the Apostles, when the Councill charged
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:34728:27"/> them, not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, aske, <hi>whether they must not obey</hi>

                        <hi>God rather than men?</hi> and justly: for they had received a charge from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, by the mouth of the Lord Jesus, <hi>in his name to Preach repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sin,</hi> and that <hi>beginning at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem;</hi>

What therefore the Divine Command had made necessary for them to be done, Humane command could not render unlawfull. And in this sense the Authors are to be explain'd, who say, the Gospel, the Ministry, the Sacraments, are not subject to Humane Power; that is, to change that, which Divine Law hath <note place="margin">11. How Religion is not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to Humane Power.</note> introduced.</p>
                     <p>For first, the Preaching of the word of salvation, and the exhibition of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, being commanded by God, cannot effectually be forbidden by men. Likewise, the Noursing of Parents o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Children, the relieving of the innocent, and many other duties, are so far exempt from Humane Law, that the prohibition of them is of no force or vertue. Secondly, the forme by God prescrib'd, for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of his word and Sacrament, cannot be alter'd by men; nor is this proper to things Sacred. For also, the Forme of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:34728:27"/> Matrimony, as it consists in the unity and individuall knot of two persons, is by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law immutable. Thirdly, it belongs not unto Humane Power, to make new Articles of Faith, or, as <hi>Justinian</hi> speaks, <hi>to innovate the Faith;</hi> nor to institute a <note place="margin">L. cum sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut.

Yet, to speak accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, these things which we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, Sacred and others, may be rather said to have something in them of immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table right, than simply and altogether exempted from the Rule of the Highest Powers; seeing there be very many and very great acts of Authority concerning them; which acts are call'd in Scripture <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 15. 30. 12.</note>
                        <hi>the Commandements of the King in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For first, it is the proper effect of the <note place="margin">12. And how it is Subject.</note> Highest Powers, that we have liberty and convenience to doe the things which God commandeth, being freed from impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and supplyed with helps. So <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> gave leave to the Jews to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staur
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:34728:28"/> the Temple, and to sacrifice there; and gave them moneys too, to beare their charges. So, by the edict of <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Licinius,</hi> the Christians had open exercise of their Religion. Secondly, not only by permitting, but (as before was touched) Humane Law, by Commanding, what Divine Law doth Command, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddes another Obligation. Thirdly, to the actions Commanded by God, the Highest Power prescribes certaine cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of place, time and manner, that they may be done <hi>decently and in order.</hi> Fourthly, from actions forbidden by God, the matter and occasions are by Humane Power withdrawn. So <hi>Ezechias</hi> brake the brasen Serpent; so the Emperours shut up the Heathen Temples. Fiftly, 'tis the part of the Highest Power, by proposing punishments, to draw men to the doing of that, which God Commands, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre them from the contrary▪ as <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar</hi> made it death to speak evill of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> God; and the Emperours, to offer sacrifice to the God of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</hi> And in these particulars consisteth, as I take it, that Office of the Highest Powers which is called by <hi>Justinian, the preservative of the Divine Lawes,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 138.</note> such a custody, which is also Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,

                        <hi>earth serve Christ, by making Lawes also on behalf of Christ.</hi> And the same particulars have place in things not Sacred, which are likewise defined one way, by that Divine Law, which the Apostle cals <hi>the righteousnesse of God.</hi> For therefore the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 3:</note> Law is said to consist, partly of Civill institutions, partly of Naturall precepts. Concerning which Naturall precepts, the Civill Law gives right and liberty to doe them, hindrances being remov'd; yea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the same things to be done; deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines circumstances; takes away, or streightens the occasions of often trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression; Lastly, addes a sanction, to them, by the constitution of punishments; which is so manifest, that we need spend no more time in this.</p>
                     <p>Let us come to those things, which by <note place="margin">13. The Highest Power may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not afore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by God.</note> the Divine Law, whether written in the hearts of men, or in the Holy Bible, are not at all determined. To determine them either way, whether they be Sacred or Profane, is the right of the Highest Power. Of prophane, 'tis most known; so <hi>David,</hi> of dividing the spoile; the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, made constitutions, of the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities <note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20. 25.</note> and effects of Contracts and Testaments, &amp; innumerable other matters.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:34728:29"/> Of Sacred things, 'tis no lesse clear, if one (I say not, diligently read) but only look into the Sacred History, the <hi>Codes</hi> of <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi> and <hi>Justinian,</hi> the Novels, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitular of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great. Every where examples are so obvious. It pertaines hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to institute Offices, more for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and ornament, than for necessity, as <hi>David</hi> did; to build or beautify tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Joas,</hi> or to appoint a Law and manner of building them, as <hi>Justinian;</hi> to prescribe the manner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Pastors, holding Synods, keeping order among Pastors, alienation of things dedicate to holy uses; all which very many Christian Emperours have done.</p>
                     <p>Now, if the Highest Power shall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede <note place="margin">14.

So Christ <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 52. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 16</note> hath taught <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> us. So saith
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:34728:29"/>
                        <hi>Ambrose, Grieve I can, weep I can, mourn I can, any other way to make resistance, I cannot, I ought not.</hi> A most holy example of that patience prescrib'd unto us by God, is left us by those antient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, that liv'd under the heavy yoake of the unbelieving Emperours. They were men to be feared for their number, had they chosen rather to shed others bloud, than their own: for, <hi>Tertullian</hi> shews how they had filled both the Camp and City. That victorious <hi>Thebane</hi> Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for Religion sake, was contented to lose every tenth man, at the Emperours Command; and, it is memorable, that when there was one Christian put to death for tearing the Imperiall edict, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Bibles to be burnt, Churches to be demolisht, and the Christians Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; the rest of the Christians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, He had justly deserved that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. So deeply had the voyce of Christ sunk into their minds, that forbids <hi>to take the sword.</hi> Every one takes the sword, who hath not receiv'd it from God. God hath given it to none, but the Supreme Powers and to such as they appoint. No examples of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament evince the contrary; for when we read of the defections of people or
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:34728:30"/> Cities from some Kings, and the impiety of the Kings set down for the cause, therein the divine judgement is described, not the deeds of men commended. But if the Highest Power, that hath undertaken the protection of true Religion, be it self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore opposed by the armes either of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign or domestick enemies, it hath all the right and reason in the world, by Arms to defend its own Authority, and the lives and fortunes of the Subjects. For 'tis all one upon the matter, whether the opposition be for Religion, or any other pretence; nor is the Power being Independent, more bound to let go the use of Religion, than the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of land, at the pleasure of any other whatsoever: <hi>For He beareth not the Sword in vain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath been shewed, I think sufficiently, <note place="margin">15. Not so many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars in Sacred things, as in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, under Humane Power: with the reason of it.</note> how the Highest Power hath equall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over actions Sacred and Prophane, over the externall primarily, and in regard of them, over the internall also in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place: I say, Authority to command and forbid, what is commanded already, and forbidden by God; to determine things left in the midst, and permitted to mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; and when force is offered under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of right, to defend it self. I say, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall Authority over Sacred and Secular
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:34728:30"/> actions: which <hi>Binius</hi> also a man of the Roman religion acknowledgeth.

But, concerning Sacred matters, much is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed us in the Gospell, and proceeds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from the will of God. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing noted, I see not any thing more, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in this question; for, that a more diligent enquiry, and greater care is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in things Sacred, both because the Law of Nature is more known than the Positive, and because errour in Religion is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; this pertains to the question of the Manner to use the Power rightly, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged nothing in the Power it selfe.</p>

That Christ In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall office, answered.</note> not the Highest Powers, ordained the Pastorall office; that, as to the substance of the office, Christ also hath set down the rules; and that, so far (as we have before acknowledged) Pastors are not the Vicars, or Deputies of the Highest Powers; all this diminisheth nothing of the right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as will appear by the examples of other things. The power of Parents o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Children, of Husbands over their Wives, hath its originall, not from any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Institution, but from God himself: yet who will deny these Powers, though more antient, to be subject to the Highest▪ The Physicians function is from God, the author of Nature, (as the Pastor's from God the author of Grace,) and from Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Experience he receiveth rules to execute his office, not from the Highest
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:34728:31"/> Powers; nor is he in their stead, when he practiseth: and yet for all this, the Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian's function is subject to the Supreme Authority. There is the same reason in other arts and professions.</p>
                     <p>And, that Pastors are not bound to obey the Highest Powers, when their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands or Prohibitions are contrary to Gods; herein is nothing singular.

Yea, the Judge, that receives his Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Highest Power, being cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the same to judge against right and reason, is not bound to obey, or rather, is bound not to obey; which comes to passe, not because the private man, or the Judge is not subject to the Highest Power; (none will imagine that:) but because both the Power and they are all subject unto God: and when Commands are contrary, the Superiour is to be preferr'd.</p>

For they that
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:34728:33"/> govern serve, <hi>by the office of consulting, and graciously providing,</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> speaks; Kings therefore may be said to serve the Church, not to be servants of the Church, in that sense, as service signifies subjection. For <hi>Saul</hi> is not the servant of <hi>Israel,</hi> but <hi>Israel</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> of <hi>Saul:</hi> and specially <note place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 8. 22. 12. 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 1. 32</note>
                        <hi>Abimelech</hi> amongst the Priests, as <hi>David</hi> among the Peers. So is <hi>Sadoc</hi> the Priest the <hi>servant</hi> of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore also the greatest Synods, being as it were a <hi>Compendium</hi> of the whole Church, living under the Roman Empire, salute the Emperours by the name of <hi>their Lords.</hi> Certainly, as a Father hath equally the Rule over his family, whether believing or not: so the peoples right Religion dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth nothing of the Right of the Highest Power.</p>
                     <p>Some think this a very strong argument <note place="margin">4. That Kings are under the Pastors function, answered.</note> against the Authority asserted to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Powers, that the Sacred Function of Pastors is conversant about Kings also, not only as the Gospel is in generall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them among the rest, but as by the Ministry of the Keys it is applyed to them in particular. But the weaknesse of this Argument is convinced by like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; for what Function is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant about the King? Husbandmen,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:34728:33"/> Merchants and the like, the King stands in need of; but to come nearer, the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician cures the King as well as his Groome, and prescribes to both what may conduce to their recovery; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Counsellour of State is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about the King, not only as a man, but as a King. Yet no man hath been so unwise, to exempt either the Persons or Functions of any of them from the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Authority, and loose them from the bonds of Humane Lawes.</p>
                     <p>We must come now unto them, who <note place="margin">5. The Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, taken from the Kingdom of Christ, answer'd. And what that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cars.</note> think all Authority about Sacred things so to belong unto Christ alone, that Kings cannot be partakers of it, because he is sufficient alone for the Administration of his Kingdome, and needs not the help of a Deputy. That we may satisfy these men, the actions of Christ must be distinguished. His <hi>Legislation,</hi> and his finall <hi>Judgement</hi> are peculiar to him. In his Legislation is comprehended not only a more plaine promulgation of the Divine Law, mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interpretations being rejected and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference laid open between the things which God alwaies approved, and those which he did wink at or beare with for a time; but also the constitution of the Evangelicall Ministry and Sacraments,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:34728:34"/> with the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law. His finall Judgement conteins the condemnation of some, and the absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others with exhibition of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Which being done, Christ shall put off the Administration of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet retein the Majesty of a King for ever. These actions therefore being done, and to be done by Christ himself; Life and Death Eternall, with the Promise, commination and adjudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the same, being not in the power of meer men; it is certaine, that in them no man is the associate or Deputy to him. But there be other actions call'd <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate:</hi> and of these againe, some are about the inward, some about the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man. Those about the inward man are partly in the man, partly concerning him. <hi>In the man,</hi> Christ works, when by the vertue of his Spirit he illuminats some, others by not illuminating he blinds; he opens the heart of some, others by not opening he hardens; sometimes he affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth greater aydes against temptations, sometimes lesse. <hi>Concerning the man,</hi> Christ works, when he remits or reteins sin: yet for the most part in those actions also some signs of them are inwardly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the man by Divine Efficacy.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:34728:34"/> All these actions exceeding the Power of meer Man, are also so peculiar to Christ, that he admits no Fellow in them nor Vicar. Ministers indeed he admits to these actions, <hi>Pastors, Private men,</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> too, every one in his way. But there is a difference between a Vicar and a meer Minister; because it is the part of a <hi>Vicar</hi> to produce actions of like kind with his actions whose place he holds, though of lesse perfection: and to a meer <hi>Minister</hi> it perteins not to produce actions of like kind, but such as are serviceable to the actions of the principall cause. Whence it appears, that the same action is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attributed, yet proportionably, both to the <hi>Principall</hi> and the <hi>Vicegerent;</hi> for the King truly Governs and gives judgement; so doth the Judge also, though not with equall Right. But, to the Principall and the meer Minister, the same action can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be accommodated without a Trope: as Pastors are said <hi>to save men, to remit and reteine their sins.</hi> There remaine the actions of Christ about the outward man: which especially consist in defence and deliverance from enemies, and in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and adorning of his Church; actions rightly referr'd unto his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And as the generall providence of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:34728:35"/> God which hath a watchfull eye over all things, although by it self it be sufficient for the disposition and execution of them; yet, for the demonstration of his mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold wisdome, He makes use of the Highest Powers, as his <hi>Deputies,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the common society of men; whence also they are stiled Gods: So that spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall providence of Christ, watching over his Church, assumes unto it self the same Powers to Patronize the true Faith; and to them Christ also imparteth his own name. These are they that, as <hi>Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen</hi> saith, <hi>rule together with Christ,</hi> not by equall fellowship of power, (far bee from us so impious a thought) but by a Vicarious and deriyed right; which is the meaning of that in the <hi>Bohemian</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Magistrates have a power common with the Lamb.</hi> Wherefore seeing things subordinate doe not fight against one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and seeing it doth not mis-become the Majesty of Christ, to execute the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall actions of his Kingdome by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self immediatly; the rest partly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, partly by others (as he uses too the Angels Ministry, out of question:) it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that the earthy Empire of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power, as it takes care of Sacred things, doth not at all oppose or stand against the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:34728:35"/> heavenly and divine Power of Christ.</p>
                     <p>And here we must admonish our Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, that in the place of Christ, <hi>the King</hi>
                        <note place="margin">6. Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws not the Authority of the H. Powers.</note>
                        <hi>of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> they may not put upon us <hi>Presbyteries</hi> and <hi>Synods;</hi> nor transferre what is proper to Christ alone, <hi>to rule over Kings,</hi> unto them, whom both the necessity of order, and divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity hath subjected to the Imperial Power. But, because in Scripture, and the antient History some <hi>Government</hi> is attributed, partly to Pastors, partly to Churches, let us see how it comes to passe, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Highest Power is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown thereby.</p>
                     <p>For the right understanding whereof, <note place="margin">Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</note> lest in the unlikenesse of things we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the likenesse of words, we must make use of some distinctions. Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is either such as may consist with the <note place="margin">Directive. Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. By Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Supreme. Inferiour. Inferior, By ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. By subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> Liberty of the Governed, or such as may not consist with it; the former agrees to them, who govern (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> speaks) <hi>by authority of persuasion, not by power of Command,</hi> as Physicians, Lawyers, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours in things not altogether necessary. The later Government, whereby the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Governed is taken away, is either Declarative of Law, or Constitutive: and this later, either by right of consent,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:34728:36"/> or by vertue of Authority. This distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on springs from the manner of introducing an obligation. They that govern declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively doe not oblige properly, but occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally, as they give a man notice of that which either brings or encreases an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. So the Physician governs his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, by shewing what is hurtfull, what is wholsome: which being known, the sick is bound to use this, avoid that, not by any Right which the Physician hath over him, but by the Law of Nature, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every one to have a care of his own life and safety. So Philosophers doe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Morall and Civill life, by shewing what is honest, what the safety of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple requires. Hither are referr'd the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations which Embassadours or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds sent by the Highest Powers make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Subjects; and as well the suasory, which we have mention'd, as the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, are wont to be comprehended under the one name of <hi>Directive regiment;</hi> from which differs the <hi>Constitutive,</hi> whether it ariseth out of <hi>Consent,</hi> a <hi>Command.</hi> That, out of consent, hath vertue to oblige all that have consented, by the naturall law, concerning the keeping of Covenants, in those things, which were in the right and power of the Covenanters. But they, that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:34728:36"/> have not consented, are not <hi>directly</hi> bound; <hi>indirectly</hi> they are, if three things concurr. First, that they are a part of the whole; Second, that the major part of the whole have consented; The third, that something must be necessarily Constituted for the conservation of the whole, or the better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. Upon these conditions, all and every one are bound, not by any Right which the major part hath over them, as Superiour, but by that Law of Nature, which requires every part, as a part, to be ordered for the good of the whole. Which good oftentimes cannot be had without some speciall determination; and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination can be of no effect, if it be lawfull for a few to undoe what was done by many. Hence it is, that the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a journey, the partners of one ship, or of the same negotiation, &amp; all Collegues are bound to stand to the decree of the major part, in those things only, that need some determination, and belong to that Community, whereof themselves are members. But the <hi>Imperative</hi> regiment obligeth by the intrinsecall force of its own supereminence; and the <hi>regiments</hi> of this kind, as hath been said, are either <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> or placed <hi>under the Supreme:</hi> and these again either derived from the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:34728:37"/> or of some other originall: these later, <hi>ordinary,</hi> as that perpetuall and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Government of the Father over his family, whence ariseth the authority of the Pedagogue and Tutour; <hi>extraordinary,</hi> such as God gave by speciall Commission to some men under the old Testament. The Powers derived from the Supreme, either have received a right both <hi>to oblige and to act,</hi> as the Praetorship; or <hi>to oblige only,</hi> as the <hi>Power of a Delegate.</hi> Without a right to oblige, there is no Power, for this is as it were, the naturall effect thereof.</p>
                     <p>Let us now apply all this unto Pastors <note place="margin">8. Pastors have no coactive or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: proved by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Fathers. 1 Pet. 5. 3.</note> and Churches.

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Judgement of the Highest Powers about Sacred things.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THe Authority of the Highest Powers about Sacred things being clear'd wee come to that which pertains to the right use of this Authority. The Commands of <note place="margin">1. The word, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</note> Authority must proceed from Judgement. Judgement properly denotes the act of a Superiour, defining what is just between two parties; and the Highest Judgement is that of the Highest Power; for the Lawes and Decrees thereof cannot be nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led or repealed by any Higher: although obedience to such Lawes and Decrees be not absolutely due, but so farre as it may be given, without violation of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Now, as the Authority is exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <note place="margin">2. It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</note> to Sacred things, as well as Secular; so is the Judgement too, according to which the Authority is used. Indeed, some Kings and Emperours have seemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject from themselves the Judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Religion: but, that was either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they found themselves unfit, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to performe that office; or else, they meant only (as the Great King of <hi>Britan</hi> interprets his own words, and some of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:34728:41"/> antient Emperours) that they did not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themselves (as the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> doth) a Judgement <hi>infallible.</hi> The <note place="margin">3. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that they may erre.</note> truth is, all Humane Judgement is subject unto error; and unlesse we will take away all Judgement out of the world, we must acquiesce in some Highest: whose errors are to bee reserved to the Judgement of God. If you grant this Highest Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane judgement (I speak not of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective</hi> judgement, but <hi>Imperative)</hi> it will not follow thence, that Pastors and other Christians may, upon the judgement and command of the Highest Power, omit the necessary duties of piety and charity: for (as above hath been shewed) the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the Highest, bidding or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, whether in Sacred things or Secular, bind us not, to doe or omit any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of God, either Naturall or Positive; but only to suffer; and that only where the paine cannot be avoided but by contrary force.</p>

In the meane time, Christ speaks by his Spirit, by Divine Judgement; yet doth not Humane action follow that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unlesse Humane Judgement be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed. Which, as it belongs to every Christian, in respect of his private acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; so, in respect of publike, and of private, that are govern'd by publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, it belongs to the Publick Powers, and to the Highest in the Highest degree. <hi>Brentius</hi> long agoe saw this, whose words are these: <hi>As a Private man hath a Private, so a Prince hath a Publick Power, to judge of the Doctrine of Religion, and to decide it.</hi> They that make the Scripture Judge, <note place="margin">5.

                        <hi>rightly judgeth of those things which hee understandeth.</hi> But this Judgement is of another kind; for it leads the way to their own actions, and the actions of others, <hi>by directing,</hi> not by commanding. And, it is not absurd to grant two Highest Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of severall sorts, such as are the <hi>directive</hi> Judgement of the Catholick Church, and the <hi>Imperative</hi> of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power; for there is no Judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men higher <hi>in esteeme</hi> than that, none higher than this <hi>in Power.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now seeing there are two enemies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">7.

                     <p>Yet, there are some that Object, and say, it cannot be that <hi>one</hi> should well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to any in particular, who hath upon <note place="margin">8. The Highest Powers capable of sufficient under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</note> him the weight of all affairs. To whom we answer: there is as it were a naturall coherence between the generall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:34728:43"/> of all, and the more exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the most noble part. So doth the Metaphysiologer generally considers all that is, and specially things incorporeall▪ the Physiologer, all that moves, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above the rest. Even so, ought the Architect of a Common-wealth to have a generall view of all affaires and studies, but a neerer and more curious insight into those of the Church.</p>
                     <p>Neither is the knowledge of Sacred <note place="margin">9. Divine things, that are necessary, are easy to bee known.</note> things so intricate, as some would make it. <hi>Theology,</hi> saith <hi>Nazianzen, is a thing simple and naked, without any great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, consisting of Divine Testimonies; which yet is depraved by some men, and turned into an art of very great difficulty.</hi> I speak of those things which are substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall points of Faith, and belong to the body of Religion; for there bee other things, partly Metaphysicall, partly Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storicall, and also partly Grammaticall, which by Divines are often handled, with great contention and clamour. With these, it is not necessary, the mind of a King should bee over-busied; no more than with the subtilties of the Law, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the prime Titles are very needfull to be known. There is a kind of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the desire of knowledge; and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:34728:43"/> the wisest man is he not that knowest most, but that knoweth what is most usefull. What the Apostle said to all, let the Highest Powers apply unto themselves, and <hi>be wise unto sobriety.</hi>

Certainly, the things which are necessary to be believed and done, and those also, which though not necessary, are of any great moment in the Church, are but few in number, and very obvious, shining forth, first in the Sacred▪ Scripture, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the perpetuall consent of more pure Antiquity.

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:34728:45"/> wrong sentence; the Judge hath done amisse, yet is not the Sentence null, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse an Appeale followes, it passes into a judged Case. A private man, that is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his own estate, hath prodigally made away his goods, the alienation is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, although the act be vitious. If parents be harsher to their Children, Masters to their Servants, than is fit; they are in fault, yet is obedience due unto them. There be many cases of like nature. The reason is, because many things are requir'd to make the action <hi>right;</hi> it must proceed from an understanding well inform'd, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest purpose of mind; it must be done in due manner, and with fit circumstances: to make the action <hi>firme</hi> only one thing is needfull, that the Agent have a right to doe it. Now an act may be out of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents right, either <hi>absolutely,</hi> when the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is unlawfull, by it self, or by reason of some Law; or <hi>relatively,</hi> when the effect is not under the Agents power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Naturally, and the law Positive se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, no act can be frustrate, but whose effect hath either some viciousnesse annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or else is beyond the Sphere of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents power. In the former respect, the command of a Father, Master, or King, is frustrate, when it enjoynes Idolatry, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:34728:46"/> a lye: in the later, the command is fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, of a Master to the Servant of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, of a King to one that is not his Subject, of whomsoever over actions meerly internal, such as have no relation to the outward. We conclude therefore, that the fault either in the understanding, or the affection, makes not void an act of Authority; but the Commands of the Highest Powers are valid still (being not contrary to Gods law) though they have not true opinions of things Divine, or serve not God aright.</p>

That any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, grounding his sentence upon the Gospell, is to be believed before the Pope, is confess'd by <hi>Panormitan</hi> and <hi>Gerson.</hi> And the pious Bishops who had learned out of the Gospell, that <hi>the Word is God,</hi> and God only <hi>One,</hi> did well in not giving place to the judgement of the Synod at <hi>Ariminum.</hi> Moreover, even when the mind doth not plainly witnesse the contrary, yet is no man bound precisely to follow anothers Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive judgement: because it is lawfull for

                     <p>There is another place, wherein some do <note place="margin">11. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.</note> much glory. <hi>Num.</hi> 27. 21. God speaks of <hi>Joshua</hi> in this manner; <hi>He shall stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Eleazar the Priest, who shall ask coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell for him, after the judgement of Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they goe out, and at his word they shall come in, both hee and all the children of Israel with him, even all the Congregation.</hi> But this place also, if it be rightly understood is far from the purpose. It is certain, the Urim, (which in other places is more fully the Urim and Thummim) was in the Ephod or pectoral of the Hebrew High-Priest. The manner of answering by Urim and Thummim, as the Jewes relate, was thus; If the matter, upon which the Question was, should suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed happily, the precious stones would sparkle with a heavenly lustre: if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:34728:55"/> they would not change their native colour. And learned men have observed out of <hi>Maimonides,</hi> that the High-priest was wont to stand before the Prince for honour sake, but the Prince stood not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priest, unlesse Urim were consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereby it appears, the honour was done to the Oracle, not the Priest; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of Urim, that is, the judgement of God, not of the Priest, <hi>Joshua</hi> must go out and in. Compare with this, another place very like it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 7. If the Ministers of the Gospel will make any use of this, then let them propose to Governours our Gospel-Urim, that they may there behold the Divine threats and promises; and let them require obedience not to themselves, but it; which shines by its own light, and is placed, not in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors only, but all Christian hearts, being <hi>that saving Grace which hath appeared unto</hi>

'Tis <hi>Nazianzen's</hi> advice, Enquire not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously into the <hi>manner</hi> of every thing; and <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>In some things even the best and most learned Catholicks doe not agree, and yet the body of faith is still entire.</hi> This modesty of defining, the Fathers in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and the first of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> and the Moderators of them the Emperours have observed; for having set down this Confession, that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct from one another, yet one God, and of the same Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; in explaining the manner of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Essence and Hypostasis, they were not sollicitous. The Bishops at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of those times, having defined, that the person of Christ is one, his Natures two, thought it not fit to enquire subtilly into the manner of hypostaticall Union. In the <hi>Milevitane</hi> and other Synods, the Fathers and the States-men present, for the vindication of Gods grace, pronounced plainly against <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his Reliques, <hi>That without the Divine grace, nothing</hi>

                        <hi>spiritually good, can be begun by man, or continued, or perfected:</hi> but many things sharply disputed about the order of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination, and about the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling mans free will with Gods free Grace, they passed over with a prudent silence. All the Fathers of the antient Church confesse, that in the most holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited the visible signs of Christ invisibly present: concerning the manner of his presence they differ in their speech, and yet for this they doe not break the Peace. Wherefore Doctrines very few are to be defined, the necessary with <hi>Anathema,</hi> the rest without: as it was done in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node of <hi>Orange:</hi> and there are in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Counsell of <hi>Carthage</hi> these words to the same purpose; <hi>It remains that we speak our opinion in this controversy, judging no man, nor separating him from our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion if he think otherwise.</hi>

I cannot forbeare to praise that excellent Canon of <hi>England,</hi> An. 1571. <hi>Let Preachers take heed of Preaching any thing to the people, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary point of Faith, but what is agreeable to the doctrine of the old or new Testament: and which the Catholic Fathers and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Bishops have collected thence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What hath been said of things to be believ'd, must be understood also of things, by the Divine Law, appointed to be done; but of these, the controversies are not so many. In both kinds, for the reteining of concord, it will be needfull to make the people understand, that all things enjoyned are agreeable to Gods word. That which <hi>Seneca</hi> saith against preambles, <hi>Let the Law command not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">15.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:34728:58"/> the Injunction is to be mollifyed by the gentlenesse of persuasion. So <hi>Plato</hi> hath given in precept, and <hi>Charondas</hi> and other Law-givers have shewed us by example. And certainly as Governments are made firme by the willingnesse of people in all things, so most of all in the businesse of Religion. For, saith <hi>Lactantius, Nothing is so voluntary as Religion; which without the wils consent is nothing.</hi> And people that are compell'd by Law to serve God, <hi>serve not God but the Prince, Themistius.</hi> Here then is required the greatest care and pains, that the major part of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, being convinc'd by divine Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, may know the things commanded, to be according to truth and piety. I say, the major part; for we may rather wish, than hope for an universall consent; but for the ignorance or malice of a few the care of truth and peace is not to be deserted. Yet here must be shewed tendernesse and discretion, that they who <hi>resist</hi> both the Divine and Humane Ordinance, may be <hi>rather withheld from doing ill, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to doe good:</hi> as <hi>Austin</hi> hath long agoe judiciously distinguisht in this matter. <note place="margin">16.

                     <p>Now we goe on to the things not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Divine Law, such as are many things belonging to Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:34728:58"/> to Rites &amp; Ceremonies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, if the matter be fresh and easy to be wrought, it were safest to restore all things to the times next the Apostles, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what was then observed, with great consent, and no lesse benefit of the Church. For the most antient Constitutions are the best. Yet there must be a respect had to the present things, and a respect to the places too: Wisely saith <hi>Jerom: In things neither contrary to Faith nor manners, let the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms of our Country be as Canons Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call. Austin</hi> and others have words of the same sense. And variety here is of good use, serving for a Testimony of Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. See the History of <hi>Socrates. l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 22. Verily, if in this nature there be any thing that may be better'd, yet is tolerable and of long continuance, 'tis wisdome to let it still continue; unlesse the change may be made upon a handsome occasion, and with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable assent. <hi>The change of a custome,</hi> saith <hi>Augustin, doth as much disturbe as profit.</hi> But in these things, wherein Gods word hath left a liberty, the Highest Power shall doe well <hi>to content the people.</hi> So in Secular matters we see that Cities and Companies that have no jurisdiction, have leave to make certaine orders for themselves; which the Highest Power,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:34728:59"/> after examination past upon them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves and ratifies.</p>
                     <p>One thing more we will not omit, which <note place="margin">17. High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers need the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> perteins also to the manner of using the Right we treat of: <hi>The Highest Power ought to use not only the advise, but service of other men:</hi> and therefore particular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, lest the multitude of them oppresse the mind of one, are to be put off to Courts ordained one above another, and the last appeal to be made to the Highest Judgement. So in the antient Church under the Christian Emperours there were Presbyteries in Cities, there were Synods Metropolitan, and Exarchicall, and, above all the rest, Imperiall; but of this we shall speak againe hereafter.</p>
                     <p>All that we have said here, of asking Counsell, of contenting the people, of inferiour Courts, and whatsoever may be added, ought not to be esteem'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and alwaies profitable; for no prudentiall precepts are universall; because prudence must have regard to emergent <note place="margin">18. Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall Rules have their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and whence.</note> circumstances. Times, Places, Persons, make a great alteration here. When the matter is clear, there is no need of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell: when dissentions are hot and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is little hope of Consent; neither can the proceeding be by degrees▪
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:34728:59"/> when either the matter will not admit delay, or the Lower Courts are suspected of injustice, by reason of hatred, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, or other impediments of upright dealing. In such cases, when the ordinary course cannot be observ'd, advise must be taken of necessity.</p>
                     <p>By the way we must note their errour, that distinguish of <hi>power absolute</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary;</hi>

                        </note> the Highest Power must leave the road and take some unusuall way; for cases are infinite, order and Law Positive finite, and the finite cannot be an adequate Rule of the infinite. But although it be <note place="margin">20.

                     <p> Wherefore we derive the originall of <note place="margin">4. But from the Law of Nature: with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of the Law of Nature, Absolute, After a sort.</note> Synods from the Law of Nature. Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a sociable creature, his nature permits association especially with them, to whom either any contemplation, or action is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. So Merchants for Traffick, Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians and Lawyers to examine the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in their Art, hold their meetings by the Law of Nature. But to avoid mistake, we distinguish between that which is <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall absolutely,</hi> and cannot be altered, as to worship God, to honour our Parents, not to hurt the innocent: and <hi>naturall after a sort,</hi> that is, permitted or allowed by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, untill some Law of man interpose; thus all things are by Nature common, all persons free, the next of kin is heir, untill by humane Constitutions propriety, and servitude be introduced, and the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance given away by Will. In this second <note place="margin">5. Synods not from the Law of Nature absolute.</note> acception, it is naturall to hold Synods; for, if it were so in the former sense, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops would never have asked the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours leave, before they met; and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom's</hi> argument, to prove a Synod unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, were not good; <hi>Shew me,</hi> saith he, <hi>what Emperour commanded the celebration of that Council.</hi> The convention therefore of a Synod is in the number of those things, which being permitted by the Law
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:34728:62"/> of Nature, are wont to be commanded by humane Law, or permitted, or prohibited. So in the Council of <hi>Agatha,</hi> the Bishops summoned to the Synod are desir'd to come, <hi>unlesse they be hindred by sicknesse, or the royall Precept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be objected, that leave to gather <note place="margin">6. Synods under the Pagan Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, by what right.</note> a Synod, was never asked of the Pagan Emperours. But we say, there was no need to ask leave, when there were no Imperiall Edicts against it. As for the antient De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of Senate against meetings, religious meetings were excepted in them, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Jewes (as <hi>Philo</hi> relates it) had leave of <hi>Augustus</hi> to assemble. In whose privileges the Christians might justly claim a share, <hi>believing all things that are</hi>

                        <hi>written in the Law and the Prophets.</hi> And <hi>Suetonius,</hi> under the name of Jewes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes the Christians too. Besides, in the places where most of the Synods were held, though subject to the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, they had the benefit of their own Lawes. Wherefore, if at any time the Churches enjoyed Peace, which often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened under Pagan Emperours, the Bishops had no hindrance, but they might meet in Synods. But in the heat of Persecution, as the Christians could not intermit Church-meetings, although forbidden by humane
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:34728:62"/> Lawes, because they were commanded by Divine; So the Bishops were carefull, not to incurre the suspition and hatred of the Rulers by Synodicall Assemblies; so long as the Church could subsist without them. <hi>Cyprian</hi> shewes in severall places, when under persecution there arose a great Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion about <hi>receiving the lapsed into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> and to the deciding of it there was need of Common-Counsell, neverthelesse the Bishops deferred their meeting till the storme was past: neither durst the Bishop of <hi>Rome, Liberius,</hi> without the consent of <hi>Constantius</hi> call a Synod. The orthodox Bishop of <hi>Spain</hi> assembled not into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Agatha,</hi> without the permission of King <hi>Alaric,</hi> although an Arian.</p>
                     <p>What the Pagan Emperours had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <note place="margin">7. Synods called by Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</note> of, that the Christian Emperours justly assumed to their care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, well considering, the corruption of any thing to be so much the worse, by how much better it is, in the regular use. After that, Synods were not left <hi>in medio,</hi> but as they gave hope of good, or fear of evill, so they were either commanded or forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Therefore <hi>Socrates</hi> the Historian saith, <hi>The greatest Synods were holden according to the Emperours pleasure.</hi> This is spoken of <hi>generall</hi> Synods in the Roman Empire;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:34728:63"/> But <hi>Constantine</hi> called also <hi>Topical,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>Eusebius</hi> speaks; <hi>Having speciall care of the Church, when discords arose in sundry places, The Emperour himself, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by God, the common Bishop or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer, commanded the Ministers of God to assemble in Councils.</hi> After the Acts of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councill were confirmed by the same <hi>Constantine,</hi> the generall Law of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods to be holden twice every year, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed the place of speciall consent. In stead of half-year Synods, in some places they had annual. Nor was the Assembly at the pleasure of the Bishops, but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of Provinces had a charge given them, to make the Bishops, though they should decline it, to meet together in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: and beside those at set times, other Synods also were holden out of order, at command of the Highest Power.</p>
                     <p>But there are three principall Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies <note place="margin">8. Three Questions about Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.</note> concerning the Highest Powers right and office about Synods. First, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be lawfull for the Highest Power to command any thing in Sacred affaires without a Synod; Second, what is lawfull for him, and what he ought to doe before the Synod, and in the Synod; Third, what after the Synod.</p>
                     <p>For the resolution of the first Question,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:34728:63"/> we must conceive, whatsoever is said very <note place="margin">9. I. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the H Power may go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</note> justly of the exceeding great commodities of Synods, belongs to the manner of using the Right of Empire, not to the Right it self. For if the Highest Power should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from the Synod any right of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning, it were not then the Highest: The Highest being that which is subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God alone, and under God hath the fullest right of governing. Again, if the Highest Power without a Synod could not command that, which it might command with a Synod, then should it receive part of the right of governing from the Synod▪ and then, because none can give what he hath not, it would follow, that somewhat of the Government were in the Synod; which the Synod, not having by any Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane right, must challenge by Divine right; whereas the Divine Law denies any such Power to have been given by God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, (as hath been shewed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,) and therefore not to Synods. The Right being thus confirmed, we make no scruple to affirme, That the Highest Power may <hi>sometimes</hi> rightly order Sacred things without a Synod: They that universally hold it unlawfull, will never prove what <note place="margin">10. The affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> they say: but we shall easily. For there are extant many examples of the Hebrew
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:34728:64"/> Kings, that without a Synod gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in Sacred matters.</p>
                     <p>Whether the Church declare or not, even before the Churches declaration the Kings duty is to reform what is amisse, and for neglect thereof he must give account to God. Eminent among the Christian Emperours is the example of <hi>Theodosius.</hi> He sate as Arbitratour between severall Factions of the Bishops, he gives every one the hearing, he reads their Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and after prayers to God for his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, he gives his judgement, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth his sentence for the Truth. To omit other examples; The Kings and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Highest Powers, which in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our fathers have purged their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from inveterate errours, have done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern of those antient Kings and Emperours: as elsewhere we have shewed. True it is, and they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their diligence that have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd it, there were such circumstances in those actions, by reason whereof that course was taken, and no other could serve the turn. And we acknowledge that course to have been extraordinary, and more sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome taken: but (as before) we say, The manner of doing being divers with regard to times and persons, changeth not the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:34728:64"/> right; but floweth from it according to the rules of prudence; Nor doth any one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, a Synod is to be omitted without cause, but that sometimes there may be causes for the omission of it.</p>
                     <p>These causes may be referr'd to two heads; either because a Synod is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, or because it appears it will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable. That both may be the better understood, we must note the Ends of a Synod in a publick Church; for of this we speak. We have proved already, that a Synod is not called, as if it had any part of the Government belonging to it. The end <note place="margin">11. Three ends of Synods: yet not necessary. Counsell. Consent. Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> therefore is, that it may give Counsell to the Prince for the advancement of Truth and Piety, that is, goe before him by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Judgement. Another end is, that by the Synod the Consent of the Church may be setled and made known. So, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Apostles severally had both knowledge and authority to define the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie of Mosaicall Ceremonies, it was for the Churches good, that it should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, they were all of one mind, and that the pious people should be taught to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the truth rightly, and to make unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous confession of it. A third end may be added to the former: as Presbyteries in a publick Church, so Synods, beside their
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:34728:65"/>
                        <hi>native,</hi> have an <hi>adventions</hi> right from Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Law: whereby they judge of Causes, as other Courts ordained by the Highest Power; and so, that upon their sentence coaction followes. But now, of all these ends none is necessary, nor is a Synod sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply necessary to those ends. Counsell is not necessary in things manifest to any one by naturall or supernaturall Light; For as <hi>Aristotle</hi> said well, <hi>Wee make use of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours in great matters, when we distrust our selves, as unable without the help of others to discern the Truth.</hi> Who doubts, but the man that denies God, or his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or his Judgement after this life; the man that makes God the proper author of all sins; the man that denies the Deity of Christ, or the Redemption wrought by him; I say, who doubts, but a man so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, may be put out of office, or out of the Common-wealth, by the command of the Highest Power, without the advise of many Counsellours? Again, the Highest Power may have such assurance out of some former Synod, that he need not call a new one. Therefore a Synod is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, to the end sufficient Counsell may be had. And as for consent of the Church to be enquir'd or constituted, 'tis in vain sometimes to take any pains about it, when
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:34728:65"/> the Church is manifestly divided two wayes, the parties and their heat being well night equall, as in the Donatists time it happen'd in <hi>Africa.</hi> Sometimes also, the consent of the Church may be known without a Synod: if there be extant the unanimons writings of almost all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Doctors in their Churches. Be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sides, every one in private may either by voice or writing declare his opinion, which <hi>Austin</hi> saith was done in his time, and commends it. And he that peruseth antient story shall find the Churches affaires more often transacted, and consent testified by communication of Letters, than by Synods: as is observed by <hi>Bilson, Reynolds,</hi> and the <hi>Magdeburgenses.</hi> And lastly, it may be the Cause in hand is so peculiar to one Church, that the consent of others is not needfull. Now for the third end of Synods, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Causes, it depends upon the will of the Highest Power, from whose Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it proceeds; although in the ordinary way, inferiour Courts are not past by, yet if those Courts be liable to some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the businesse will not bear delay, the Highest Power may call it from them to himself. We conclude therefore, that which <hi>Whitaker</hi> and others have written before, and the example of Free Cities,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:34728:66"/> that without a Synod preserve their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, doe confirm: A Synod is not at all times necessary, nor in every case.</p>
                     <p>So far from necessary sometimes, that <note place="margin">12. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times not usefull.</note> it is not profitable; for as the parts are, such is the whole. I will not here repeat the old complaint almost of all ages, that the chiefest distempers of the Church have proceeded from the Priests. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> hath said enough, where he also renders the principall causes thereof, the Ambition and Pride of Church-men; nor doth hee speak of Arian Synods only, but of all of his time, those especially wherein himself was present: <hi>Therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>have I withdrawn my self, and sought for security of mind in rest and solitude.</hi> This evill will happen if it appear, either that the integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgement is hindred by vehement prejudices, (which often befalls men, not malitious:) or that factions are so preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, that a farther branch may rather bee expected from the Synod, than any testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of consent. I much wonder, what came in some mens minds, when they said, They that accuse another of impiety, may <note place="margin">13. Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers may not be Judges in a Synod.</note> be his Judges also in a Synod; and, that the Right of refusing, which hath place in civill affairs, cannot be extended to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall. For certainly, the common
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:34728:66"/> Rules, which arise out of naturall equity, ought to be of force, no lesse in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall than other judgements; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Optatus</hi> speaking properly of the Ecclesiasticall, saith, <hi>Judges must be sought, which are not of either party, because judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is hindred by affection.</hi> In the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> the Judges charge the Legats of the Roman B. they should put off the Judges person, if they would be the accusers of <hi>Dioscorus;</hi> And <hi>Athanasius</hi> would not come unto the Synods, wherein 'twas manifest the adverse party raigned. Such is often the face of things, that a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod <note place="margin">14. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hurtfull.</note> may be hurtfull at the present, which if you stay awhile, and let the mindes of men come to a calme, may be called to good purpose. <hi>Time shall declare,</hi> saith the <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 13</note> Apostle, <hi>the work,</hi> that is, <hi>the doctrine of</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15.</note>
                        <hi>every one:</hi> And, <hi>If any man be otherwise minded, God shall reveale the truth.</hi> In both places shewing, there is often need of time, that the Truth may be found out, and a right judgement given. The contrary may also happen, that the present evill cannot endure the delay of a Synod, and calls for a more compendious remedy. Moreover, the same causes for which great Assemblies are suspected by the Highest Power, may also have place in Synods;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:34728:67"/> for, as a very learned man hath said, <hi>It is not lesse Politicall, to assemble Bishops, than other Orders of men.</hi> There is the same fear, the same danger, unlesse they have put off Humane passions, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Pastors. I might reckon up many examples of unhappy Councils, as were under <hi>Constantine,</hi> those of <hi>Antioch, Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria</hi> and <hi>Tyrus;</hi> the Bishops of which last, as the Emperour in his Letters plainly tells them, did nothing else but sow divisions and hatred, and disturb the Peace of the world. Yet I confesse, the Church is not in the best condition, when Synods cannot be had: and therefore all means is to be used, that these Assemblies may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd, or after long omission restor'd, whereby the Church speaks both to her Members, and her Governours with most convenience. And yet, even then, when <note place="margin">15. What may serve in their stead.</note> the Highest Power governs without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Synod, it hath the judgement of the Church in former Synods; it hath the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall consent of the most famous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which flourished in every Age and Nation; it hath the most learned and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Divines of the time present, both do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick and forraign, whose opinions are worthy of an equall regard, especially in points of Doctrine, which is the common
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:34728:67"/> study of them all, and in respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have every one a share in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversall Episcopacy. <hi>In making Church-Laws, the King</hi> (saith the Bishop of <hi>Ely) made use of men fit to be advised with, men who in reason are esteemed most understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, most able and judicious to answer in such affairs:</hi> and saith <hi>Burhil, He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed by Ecclesiasticall Councils, or in defect of these, by Authors for their Faith and skill in these matters most approved.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon the premises, we see there are <note place="margin">16. Other causes to deny Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side the generall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note> other causes, beside the great corruption of Religion, in contemplation whereof Synods may or ought sometimes to be omitted: and therefore they were not so often granted by the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as they were desired. <hi>All are Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners to your Grace with sighs and tears,</hi> saith <hi>Leo</hi> to <hi>Theodosius, that you would please to command a Synode in</hi> Italy. Yet he <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Epist.</hi> 24.</note> prevailed not; yea in vaine did the Right of calling Synods belong unto the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, if upon just cause they could not deny to call them. It is certaine, the Churches which were sick of the Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitarian errour, could not be accounted past all hope, yet the Electors and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to whom the Laws of <hi>Germany</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the care of Religion, without a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:34728:68"/> by the Counsell of wisemen, expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this disease out of their Dominions; and are praised for it, by the same persons, who will not acknowledge the Right, on which alone that Reformation depends. The office of a Prince, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>In</hi> 4. <hi>praec. loc.</hi> 5.</note> others with him note, partly consists in this, that, untill a free Councill may be had, which cannot be had at all times, He command <hi>the dissenting parties to use, not</hi>

                        <hi>their own, but the tearms of Scripture, and forbeare to condemne each other in publick.</hi> This also pertains to the Right of ruling before a Synode, and therefore without a Synode.</p>
                     <p>It doth not follow hence, that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of judgeing, which by Divine right is due to Divines, is taken from them; for they may, also out of Synods, deliver their judgement, either before the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Powers, or if it be needfull, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers too: and they may render the reasons of their judgement out of the word of God.</p>
                     <p>The summe is this, Synods, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse are the most usuall help of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Churches: yet we hold, such time may fall out, that Synods may not be profitable and convenient, much lesse necessary. And our greatest wonder is,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34728:68"/> the boldnesse of some men, that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, even when the Powers take on them <note place="margin">18 Synods not cald without the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</note> the protection of the Church; whether they will or no, Synods may lawfully and rightly be assembled. <hi>Beza</hi> was of another mind, who hath said, <hi>Synods are to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not without the command and favour of the King. Junius</hi> was of another mind, who said. <hi>'Tis an unjust and dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the Church, to hold a generall As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, without his knowledge and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, who is set to keep order amongst men.</hi> Lastly, of another mind were All, that have hitherto defended the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant cause against the Papists.</p>
                     <p>Next concerning the Right and Office <note place="margin">19. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Highest power may choose the Synod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</note> of the Highest before and in the Synode, it is controverted, <hi>Whether it be lawfull for the power to designe the persons, that shall come unto the Synode, or no.</hi> It is lawfull, we doubt not: but to cleare the matter, let us proceed in order.</p>
                     <p>After that Christ instituted the Church <note place="margin">20. The Right of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church. And the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of Bishops.</note> and the Pastorall office, it hath been law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by the Law of Nature; not the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable Law, but by that which hath place untill some other Provision be made; for the Church, in things concerning the Church; or, for the Pastors, in things concerning the Pastorall office, to make
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:34728:69"/> choice of them that shall goe to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>node: because, no Humane Law, no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment interceding, to determine the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, there is no other way. By this right, the Brethren of <hi>Antioch</hi> send some of their number with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 2. 22.</note>

Here then is no election, but that the Bishops seeme to have taken with them to the Metropolitan Synods some Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons at their own pleasure. That greater Synods might assemble, the <note place="margin">21.

                        <hi>Encyclic</hi> Letters of the Emperours were sent to the Metropolitans, and for the most part the election of their fellow-Bishops was imposed on them, to compleat the number which the Emperours had prescribed. This appears by the Letters of <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Valentinian</hi> to <hi>Cyrill,</hi> the like whereof were sent to all the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, as the Acts doe testify.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:34728:69"/> which election the Metropolitans made sometimes alone, sometimes with the Provinciall Synode of their Bishops. Of the suffrages of the Church or people there is no appearance. The Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, in case any of them could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in Synods themselves, sent some Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop or Presbyter to supply in their names, and to keep their places.</p>
                     <p>Albeit this were the most frequent <note place="margin">22. The Highest Power may elect Pastors for the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by reason, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples.</note> manner of election, yet by no Law was the Highest Power forbidden to call Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods of Pastors elected by his own dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion. This alone is enough to prove a permission; but reason doth evince the same: if we consider the ends before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, for which Synods are assembled. For first, many Synods are had only for Counsell; but naturally it is lawfull for every one to chose his Counsellours; so it is in questions of the Law, of War, of Merchandise, and all other affairs: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween which and the Ecclesiasticall, as to meere consultation, there is no dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Synods are also holden for the exercise of Externall Jurisdiction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them by the Highest Power; but this is also naturall for every one to choose his Delegate. In the Synods, that are gather'd for procuring of consent, the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:34728:70"/> case is somewhat different, in these it seems very expedient, that the Election be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Churches or by the Pastors, to the end, the acts of the Synod may be more passable; for men are wont to like those things best, which are done by those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose faith and diligence themselves have chosen. This therefore belongs not to the Right, but to the prudent Use of it; and is not perpetuall; because it may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen, that the election made by Pastors may be lesse available to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, than if it be made by the Highest Powers. Againe; in a Synod held for Counsell or Jurisdiction, because the Highest powers take not notice of all able men, it may be best sometimes to receive them upon the commendation of the Church or Pastors. We say then, not that the Highest Power <hi>ought</hi> alwaies to choose the persons, but that he alwaies <hi>may.</hi> Our leader in this judgement is <hi>Marsilius Patavinus;</hi> for he saith, It per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to the Authority of a Law-giver, <hi>to call a generall Councill, and to determine fit persons for it;</hi> by determining, he means not only approbation of the persons, but election too; and herein he is followed by the Learned French Defender of the Protestants cause against the <hi>Trent</hi> Synod.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:34728:70"/> Nor are examples wanting. The King of <hi>Israel</hi> cals unto him what Prophets he will, and namely <hi>Michaia</hi> at the persuasion of <note place="margin">1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.</note>
                        <hi>Jehosophat.</hi> The Donatists request a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Constantine,</hi> to judge between them and other <hi>African</hi> Bishops, by this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, <hi>We beseech you, excellent Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, because you are of a just and Royall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, whose Father was no persecutour; and because</hi> Gallia <hi>is not infected with this iniquity, that your piety would command Judges for us thence, to allay the contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here.</hi> Not the Churches, not the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Gallia,</hi> but the Emperour names the Judges. To the first Synod of <hi>C. P. Theodosius</hi> admitted also <hi>Macedonian</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops: who were not surely chosen by the Churches or Bishops Catholick. That o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Emperours and Kings used the same Right is very certaine. And this very thing did the Protestants desire of the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift; and the other Kings; that they might have leave to choose pious and learned men, and send them to the Synod. But here we must <note place="margin">23. When the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is permitted to others, the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</note> observe, when the Churches or Bishops choose men for the Synod, whether by their Native or Dative Liberty, The Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour hath an undeniable power still over that election; For all
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:34728:71"/> use of Liberty, as above is said, is subject to Command; and the vertue thereof is this, that for just causes some turbulent men, or otherwise unfit, may be excluded from publick businesse.</p>
                     <p>That the time and place were prescribed by the Emperours for the Councill; the things also to be done, and the manner of doing; that Synods were translated at their pleasure, or dissolved, both others before us, and we also have made so plain, that I think it will be denyed by none. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us now rather see, what Judgement in the Synod is competent to the Highest Power. They phansie to themselves an <note place="margin">24. The H. Power may judge in Synod.</note> Adversary over whom they may get an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie victory, who take the pains to prove, that the Bishops judged, not the Emperours alone; for who ever did so forget himself as to deny that? but this we affirme; The Highest Power hath right to Judge toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Pastors: the proofe whereof is needlesse here, because above we have made good to the H. Power an Universall right of judging, which certainly by the Synod cannot be taken away. But whether it be best for the Supreme Governour to expresse himself, and how far, is another question.</p>
                     <p>Let us goe through every end of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:34728:71"/> If a Synod be had for Declarative <note place="margin">25. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be expedient or no, in person.</note> judgement, that is, that the Bishops may shew out of the holy Scripture, what is true, what false; what is lawfull, what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; here the King, being well versed in the Bible, cannot be depriv'd of that which is granted to private men, <hi>to search the Scriptures, to try the spirits.</hi> But here must be exceeding great Caution, lest the Majesty of one, bridle the Liberty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. 'Twas said of old, <hi>Caesar, when will you give your Vote? if first of all, I shall have one to comply with.</hi> Yet will it be most profitable, that the Supreme Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour not only honour the Assembly with his presence, but also order and moderate the actions, enquire into the grounds of every sentence, and propose objections. Which the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> did in the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> in that of <hi>Francford.</hi> But when the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, in things not determined by Divine Law, gives Counsell to the Highest Power, what is for the Churches benefit; here also it is better to propose the incommodities with the commodities, than to deliver judgement openly: according to that Rule, <hi>What should be done, debate with many; what shall be done, determine with a few.</hi> The royall presence also, when the Synod
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:34728:72"/> is held chiefly to testifie the Churches Consent, is of good effect, to curb the boldnesse of turbulent men: but, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governour shall be more assured, whether the consent be true and spontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, if he give no suffrage, but he content to reserve the <hi>Epicrisis,</hi> or finall determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himself. And this hath place too, in the Synod, which by concession of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law, doth exercise some Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Supreme Governour may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and give Sentence if he please, but 'tis more proper for him, that he reserve himself entire for the <hi>Epicrisis,</hi> or Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after.</p>
                     <p>We have spoken of the Highest Power, <note place="margin">26. The Highest Powers present in Synods by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties.</note> when it self is present in the Councill; but pious Emperours could not alwayes be so, by reason of other affaires: and then they sent others in their name, with Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on either to judge together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or only to preserve good order. For in the Synod of Chalcedon, it is clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that the Senators and Judges inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed often, and gave their Sentence in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the very Articles of faith; but in that of <hi>Ephesus, Candidian</hi> was not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Theodosius</hi> to passe his judgement. To the Councill of <hi>Tyrus, Constantine</hi> sent only <hi>Dionysius,</hi> a man of Consular degree,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:34728:72"/> to observe all that passed; but he went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his Power, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> notes; <hi>Hee had all the talk, and the Bishops observed him in silence.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now we come to that Judgement, <note place="margin">27. III. What is the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers right after Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. The <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisis:</hi> wherein is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd right to change, to adde, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</note> which belongs to the Highest Power after Synod; the Greek Fathers call it <hi>Epicrisis.</hi> This is so proper to the Highest Power, that it must not be cast off or neglected by Him. For if the Synod only give Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell in things to be done by the Highest Power, 'tis certain His judgement, to whom the Counsell's given, ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, whether it be led by certain arguments (as is necessary in the matter of Faith) or in some sort by the Authority of other men. For (as above) some Judgement of the doer must precede every act, that it may be right; but absolutely, and in all things, no man can square his judgement by that of another, unlesse it be such a judgement as is infallible; but the Judgement of a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod is not such. If some Doctrine be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, or some Law Divine, 'tis not only the Right, but the Duty of the Highest Power, to see <hi>whether the Synod walked ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule of Holy Scripture:</hi> as <hi>Constantine</hi> writes of himself to those that met in <hi>Tyrus.</hi> For 'tis his part to Govern. What if some Synod, (such as many have
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:34728:73"/> been, and many may be,) shall either through ignorance, or by conspiracy, or because the greater party overswayes the better, agree upon some doctrine, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly repugnant to the Catholic faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Scriptures? Suppose the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimin,</hi> the <hi>Seleucian,</hi> (both which were greater than the <hi>Nicene)</hi> or suppose the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod; Shall the H. Power now command any thing to be done, which the Law Divine, and his conscience instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by that Law forbid? No man in his right mind will say so. But if somewhat be conceived by the Synod, which by Divine Law is not determined, but pertains unto Church-government, since all Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether introduc'd by Nature, or by Positive Law, is under that Power which among men is Highest; it is the part of this Highest to see whether the things conceived will be usefull for the Church; for to the last agent belongs also to give the last Judgement. Therefore have Synods submitted both their Articles and Canons to Emperours and Kings; but with diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent respect; the Articles to be examined by Sacred Writ (for the true doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse examination, the false, even after Synod, deserve rejection:) the Canons to be tryed according to the Rules of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:34728:73"/> and if profitable, they received the force of Lawes. Concerning the Canons are those words out of the Councils of <hi>France; If there be any defect, let it be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by His prudence; if any thing amisse, let it be corrected by His judgement.</hi> Wherefore not only the right of <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> (as some doe now) but of examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, taking away, adding, correcting, did the antient Bishops ascribe unto the Highest Powers. Nor indeed can any one, with reason, be said to <hi>approve</hi> any of those things, which are not in his Power to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approve. He is properly said to consent, who may also dissent, according to that in <hi>Seneca; If you would know whether I am willing, allow me Power to be unwilling:</hi> and <hi>Aristotle, Where to doe is in our choyce, there is also, not to doe.</hi> This is certain, some Canons have been disallowed; a great part of the Chapters, which in the year 856. the Bishops set forth in Synods, was rejected by <hi>Carolus Calvus:</hi> as we read in his <hi>Capitula.</hi> And <hi>Carolus Magnus</hi> made some addition to the Decrees of the Synod holden at <hi>Theodons. Wee adde,</hi> saith he, <hi>this of our own.</hi> Lastly, where a Synod hath passed judgement by a Power deriv'd from Humane Law, here it is much lesse to be doubted, but that His judgement is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:34728:74"/> to the Supreme Governour. For all Jurisdiction, as it flowes from him, returns to him again. Hither I refer that Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Synod, whereby <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storius</hi> was cast out of his Patriarchship. The Synod prayes the Emperour, that what was done against <hi>Nestorius</hi> might be of force.</p>
                     <p>One may object, that where the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <note place="margin">28. An objection answered.</note> Governour was himself present in the Council, there at last nothing remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but to confirm the acts with his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. But, neither can this be granted. For when the Supreme Governour judged among others, he Judged not as Supreme; for he might be Inferiour in the Suffrages. Wherefore his finall Judgement must still remain safe unto him, I mean his Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive judgement, and that in the freest man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The same is true of the Magistrates, <note place="margin">D. quando appell.</note> if they be present in any Court under their Authority.</p>
                     <p>But we must observe, that the Supreme <note place="margin">28. The manner of giving the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisis,</hi> or finall judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And of Appeal.</note> Governour exerciseth this Imperative Judgement, sometimes wholly by himself; sometimes partly by others, partly by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; Which appears by instance in Civill affaires. For Kings, unto whom supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made against the sentence of the <hi>Praetonian Prefects,</hi> or of the chief Senate,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:34728:74"/> do for the most part commit the last hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cause to men of Law; whose sentence, unlesse it be suspected, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm; sometimes, they command the Cause to be pleaded all again before themselves. So in causes Ecclesiasticall, it was the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome for Emperours to commit the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the examination of other Bishops, for their religion and wisedome most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and, taking account of them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what in their own discretion they jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged best. And this is the cause why against former Synods, other new, and these not greater than the former, were so often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: not because this Synod by it self was Superiour unto that; but, these men had greater credit with the Emperours, than the former. It was but seldome, that the Emperours heard all the Cause again themselves: as <hi>Constantine,</hi> after the Church had judged twice, himself exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd the Cause of <hi>Caecilian,</hi> and gave fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Judgement in it. He also call'd before him the Bishops who had met at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> to render him an account of all their doings. Wherein he is justly defended by our Men against the Patrons of the Roman Sea.</p>
                     <p>It is true in Sacred no lesse than in other masters; that an <hi>Appeale</hi> strictly taken, which inhibites the execution of Sentence
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:34728:75"/> given, may by the Civill Law be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: but then there is left open another way; to implore the Hearing of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power, by Complaint or Supplication. For if this be denyed, the King <hi>could not scatter away all evill from his throne, Hee could not be a terrour to all evill,</hi> which is his perpetuall office: so that the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man said well to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon, If he were not at leisure to be Judge, Hee should not be at leisure to be King. Maecenas</hi> saw <note place="margin">Dio.</note> this of old, who sheweth to <hi>Augustus,</hi> that no man (under the Highest) ought to have so much Power committed to him, as that from him there should be no appeal.</p>
                     <p>One thing more must be remembred <note place="margin">29. The <hi>Epicrisis</hi> in parts of Religion, as well as in the whole.</note> here, that the right of the H. Power, after the Synod, to determine any thing against the Synod, cannot be contracted only unto those Controversies, wherein as it were the whole body of Religion is in Question. For there is the same right in the parts, as in the whole: and the reasons before alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged give unto the H. Power a free finall Judgement, in single Questions, as well as in all together. For also in single Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Synods may erre, neither ought the H. Power to yield blind obedience to them, much lesse by its Authority to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend a false and hurtfull doctrine; or suffer
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:34728:75"/> the truth to be oppressed; nor can the wisdome of the Highest Power permit errours to encrease by little and little, and as their nature is, one beget another, till their number be so great that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rooted out without hazard of the Common-wealth.</p>

<pb n="140" facs="tcp:34728:76"/> as the more noble. Thence it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that a Law is made either of the things defined by Law Divine, or of those that are left undefined. The Laws that are made, either respect the whole body of Religion, or the parts of it.</p>
                     <p>In nothing more shines forth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue <note place="margin">3.

This, all that have written Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks put in the chiefest place, among the Rights of Majesty; and experience proves the same. For if you enquire, Why in <hi>England</hi> under Queen <hi>Mary</hi> the Roman Religion was set up, but under Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisabeth</hi> the Evangelicall; the nearest cause cannot be rendred, but from the will and pleasure of the Queens; or (as some will have it) of the Queens and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Enquire, why one Religion is in <hi>Spaine,</hi> another in <hi>Denmark,</hi> another <hi>Sweden;</hi> you must have recourse to the Supreme Governours will.</p>
                     <p>But many doe object, If that be so, the <note place="margin">4. Answer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the change of Religion.</note> State of Religion will be very unconstant, especially where one is Ruler over all; for upon change of the Kings mind, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion also will be changed. 'Tis true indeed, that they say: but that danger is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:34728:76"/> in all other things as well as Sacred. The work will be like the work-man; and the Law be as the King. Yet no mans right is to be denyed him, for the danger of abusing it: for then no mans right shall be safe. Besides, although the Highest Power should transfer that right upon another (which we have shewed he may not) the same danger would still remaine; for the right would but passe from men to men: and every man may be deceived. Here then, our only comfort lyes in the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence. Indeed the hearts of all men God hath in his power, but, <hi>The Kings</hi>

                        <hi>heart is in the Lords hand,</hi> after an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall manner. God doth his work, both by good and evill Kings. Sometimes a calme, sometimes a storme is for the Church more usefull. If the Governour be pious, if a diligent reader of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, if assiduous in prayer, if Reverent to the Catholick Church, if ready to heare wise Counsels, by him will the truth be much advanced. But if he be of a perverse or corrupt judgement, it will be more hurtfull to himself than to the Church; for he must expect a heavy judgement from the King thereof, who will not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Church to be unrevenged. The Church in the meane while, ceaseth not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:34728:77"/> to be the Church; yea, if the King rage against it, it will gather strength and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease under persecution.</p>
                     <p>Certainly, 'twas never lawfull for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects <note place="margin">5.

'Tis the Office of the Highest Power alone publickly to autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize the true Religion, and to remove the false. To remove Idols out of private places belongs to the Lord of the place; and upon his neglect, to the King as the Lord generall: but to remove them out of the publick place is the right of the Highest Power, and to whomsoever it shall delegate that Office.

For those punishments of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable Delinquents in Religion, which left them time of repentance, the antient Church approv'd. But the paine of Death was so much against the gentlenesse of the old Religion, that <hi>Idacius</hi> and <hi>Ithacius</hi> were condemned by the Bishops of <hi>Gallia,</hi> for being Authors, that certaine <hi>Priscil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianists</hi> should be confuted with the sword: and in the East a whole Synod was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, which had consented to the burning of <hi>Bogomilus.</hi>

                     <p> Yet sometimes also false Religions have <note place="margin">7.

Neither were the Pagan rites prohibited by <hi>Constantine</hi> at the beginning of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, but he advanced Pagans to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulship, as <hi>Prudentius</hi> notes to <hi>Symachus</hi> So <hi>Jovinian</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Princes worthy of all praise, terrified not them with threatning edicts, that violated the verity and unity of the Christian Law. And which is more to be noted, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours did not only permit impunity to disagreeing sects, but often made Laws to order their Assemblies. <hi>Constantine</hi> and following Emperours grant to the chief Rulers of the Jewish Synagogues the same Rights with Christian Bishops. So <hi>Theodosius</hi> forbids any to be received into their Sect against the will of their Primates; and forbidding them to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into their Assemblies, that deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Resurrection and Judgement, or would not acknowledge the Angels to be Gods creature, He saith <hi>he had reformed the Jewish Nation.</hi> So the Proconsuls took away the Churches of the Donatists from

Reason, because it cannot be otherwise, but He that hath right upon the whole, hath right upon the parts. Examples are at hand: <hi>Ezechias,</hi> that he might suppresse the adorers superstition, took away the Serpent set up by <hi>Moses;</hi> and by the same right, against the Decrees of the second <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, <hi>Charles the Great</hi> forbad the adoration of Images. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norius</hi> and <hi>Arcadius</hi> repressed, by their Edict, <hi>Pelagius</hi> and <hi>Coelestius,</hi> the authors of a false opinion: and so of late, some of the German Princes have purged their Churches (otherwise well ordered) of the <note place="margin">9.

So <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperour prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the single and the double <hi>Energy</hi> to be ascribed to Christ; that this is not to be dislik'd, we have the authority of St. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil</hi>

                     <p>To proceed; That the Powers also used <note place="margin">11. Lawes about things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Divine Law; And that, beside the Canons.</note> their Authority in defining things which the Divine Law hath left undefined; is most plain. The King of <hi>Ninive</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam'd a Fast; <hi>David</hi> commands the Ark to be transported; <hi>Solomon</hi> orders all things for the ornament of the Temple, and after him <hi>Josias:</hi> who also takes care, that the Treasure destin'd for Sacred uses be not alienated. Of this kind is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test part of Constitutions which appear in <hi>Theodosius</hi> and <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Code, and in the Novels, and in the French Capitulars: as, of the age of Bishops, Presbyters, Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses, of the immunity and judgements of the Clergy-men, and infinite other things, which were tedious to number. That in those Lawes are Constituted many things that are not in the Canons, both the Reading shewes, and <hi>Whitaker</hi> confesses. Therefore also in the <hi>Trent</hi> Synod, the King of <hi>France</hi> doubted not to declare by his Orators, <hi>That the most Christian Kings</hi> (so 'tis in the Acts) <hi>have made many E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts in matters of Religion, after the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of</hi> Constantine, Theodosius, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:34728:80"/> Justinian, <hi>and other Christian Emperours; That they have made many Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Lawes, and such as the antient Popes not only were not displeased with, but some receiv'd into their Decrees; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem'd the chiefe authors of them,</hi> Charles the Great, <hi>and</hi> Lewis the Ninth▪ <hi>most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kings, worthy the name of Saints; That the Prelates of France, and the whole Order Ecclesiasticall, according to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script of those Lawes, have piously and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianly ruled and govern'd the Church of France.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the mean time it is most true, that the <note place="margin">12. Yet the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons are of use, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Lawes.</note> Emperours for the most part in making lawes had respect unto the Canons, old, or new: whence is that saying, <hi>The Lawes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain not to imitate the Sacred Canons;</hi> For, in things not defined by Divine Law, the Canons are usefull to the Law-giver two wayes. They doe both contain the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of wise men, and make the Law more gracious in the subjects eye. This, as it is not necessary to the right making of a Law; so, if it may be obtained, is very profitable. <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Novel is Extant, wherein he gives <hi>the force of Lawes to the Ecclesiasticall Canons, set forth, or confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the four Synods, the</hi> Nicene, <hi>the first of</hi> Constantinople, <hi>the first of</hi> Ephesus,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:34728:80"/>
                        <hi>and that of</hi> Chalcedon. Where by the word <hi>Confirmed,</hi> we must understand the Canons of the old Provinciall Councils, which being generally receiv'd, were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contained in the Code of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Canons.</p>
                     <p>Now to that which some Enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">13. No Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power belongs to the Church by Divine Right.</note> the Church hath any Legislative Power, the Answer may be given out of our former Treatise. By Divine Law it hath none. Before the Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, the Decrees of Synods, for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or the ornament of the Church, are not called Lawes but Canons, and they have either the force of Counsell only, as in those things that rather concern single persons, than the whole Church; or else they bind, by way of Covenant, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the unwilling being the fewer, by necessity of determination, and therefore by the Law of Nature, not by any humane Authority. <note place="margin">14. Yet it may be granted by the Law Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatively; and not without subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>This notwithstanding, some Legislative Power may be granted by Humane Law, to Churches, Pastors, Presbyters, or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods. For if to other Companies and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, whose usefulnesse is not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Church, that Power (as we have said above) may be granted by the Supreme Governour; why not also to the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:34728:81"/> Church, especially when no Divine Law is against it. But two things must be here observed. First, this Legislation granted, doth not at all diminish the right of the H. Power, ('tis granted <hi>Cumulatively,</hi> as the Schooles speak, not <hi>Privatively:)</hi> for the H. Power, though it may communicate to another the right of making Lawes gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or speciall, yet can it not abdicate the same right from it selfe. Next, the Lawes made by any such Company, may, if there be cause, be nulled and corrected by the H. Power. The reason is, two Lawyers, both highest, cannot be in one Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: and therefore the Inferiour must obey the Superiour. Hence it is, that for the most part, in the constitutions of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, we see the assent of the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er expressed in these words: <hi>At the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conc. Tolet.</hi> 6. <hi>Can.</hi> &amp;c.</note>
                        <hi>of the King; By the Decree of the most glorious Prince, the Synod hath Constituted or Decreed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may be objected here, That Kings <note place="margin">15. How Kings have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound by Canons.</note> sometimes affirme they are bound by the Canons, and forbid to obey their Edicts contrary thereto. But this is of the same sense, as when they professe to live by their own Lawes, and forbid their Rescripts if they are against the Lawes, to be observ'd. For such professions take not away their
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:34728:81"/> Right, but declare their will: As a clause added in a former Testament, derogating from the later, makes the later of no value; not because the Testator might not make a later Testament, but because what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in it is supposed not approved by his free and perfect Judgement. And hence it is, that if there be a speciall derogation from the derogating clause, as the later Testament is of value; so is the later Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution too.</p>
                     <p>But that Canons have been nulled and <note place="margin">16. The Canons dispensed with by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. 1. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall.</note> amended by Emperours and Kings, and that Synods ascrib'd that Power to them, was prov'd sufficiently, when we treated of Synods. Yea, (which is more) even those Canons, which are found in the Apostles writings were not perpetually observ'd. The reason is, because they were supposed to contain not so much an exposition of Divine Law, as Counsell accommodated to those times. Such is the Canon to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 6.</note> That a Neophite be not made a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop: which was renewed in the Synod of <hi>Laodicea.</hi> Yet in the Election of <hi>Nectarius</hi> this Canon was layd by, by <hi>Theodosius;</hi> and by <hi>Valentinian,</hi> in the Election of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi> And such is that Canon, That a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 9.</note> under sixty be not chosen for a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesse: which <hi>Theodosius</hi> also constituted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:34728:82"/> by a Law. Yet <hi>Justinian</hi> permitted one of fourty to be chosen. 'Tis not to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">17.

There was a Law, <hi>That no unclean person should eat the Passeover:</hi> Yet <hi>Ezechias,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving poured forth his prayers to God, granted an Indulgence to the unclean to eat thereof. Again, the Law was, that the Beasts should be slain by the Priests: and yet twice under <hi>Ezechias</hi> the Levites, by reason of the want of Priests, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to this office. Not that the Kings loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any one from the bond of Divine Law (for that can no man doe) but that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to equity, the best Interpreter both of Divine and Humane Law, they declared the Law Divine, in such a Constitution of affaires, to lose its obligation, according to the mind of God himself. For such a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, as in private actions, and not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of delay, it is wont to be made by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, (So <hi>David</hi> and his companions interpreted the Law, which permits the Priests only to eat of the Shew-bread, to have no binding force in the case of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme hunger) so in publick actions, or in private also that may be delay'd, it is to be made by the Highest Power, the Defender and Guardian of Divine Law, according to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:34728:82"/> the counsell of wise and godly men. And hither, for conclusion, I refer, that in the time of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> it was enacted that it should be lawfull to give battell to the Enemy on the Sabbath day.</p>

                        <p>Of Jurisdiction about Sacred things.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>TO Legislation, Jurisdiction is coherent, <note place="margin">1. Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</note> with so neer a tye, that in the highest degree one cannot be without the other. Wherefore if the Supreme Legislation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Sacred things, under God, agrees to the Soveraign Power; it followes, that the Jurisdiction also agrees unto it. Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is partly Civill, partly Criminall. 'Twas a point of Civill Jurisdiction, that the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Sea of <hi>Antioch</hi> was abjudged and taken away from <hi>Paulus Samosatenus.</hi> The Criminal, from the chiefe part of it is call'd the Sword; <hi>Hee beareth not the Sword in vain, but is an avenger upon all that do evill:</hi> therefore upon them too, that doe evill in matters of Religion. Of this sort was the <note place="margin">2. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it are decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> command of <hi>Nebuchodonosor</hi> the King, that they should be torn in pieces, who were contumelious against the true God; and that of <hi>Josias,</hi> wherby Idolaters were put to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:34728:83"/> Death. Relegation also belongs to Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So <hi>Solomon</hi> confin'd <hi>Abiathar</hi> the Priest; without any Council, as the Bishop of <hi>Ely</hi> well notes; 'twas indeed for treason, but he had as good Right to punish him, if the offence had been against the Divine Lawes. So the Christian Emperours ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisht <hi>Arius, Nestorius,</hi> and other He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques. <hi>Esdras</hi> and his associates received Jurisdiction from <hi>Artaxerxes;</hi> whereby they punished the obstinate Jewes with the publication of their goods, and ejection out of the publick Society. The very same punishment in the Gospell is call'd <hi>Casting out of the Synagogue.</hi> For as <hi>Esdras</hi> had all kind of Jurisdiction by the grant of the Persian King: so by the permission of the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Emperours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, the Synedry of the Jewes retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this part of it, with the power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and scourging. We learn out of the Hebrew masters, that there were three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of casting out of the Synagogue: by the first, <hi>Nidui,</hi> the party was commanded to stand off in the Synagogue in a meaner place: by the second, <hi>Cherem,</hi> He was not permitted to appear in the Synagogue, nor any other suffer'd to make use of him, nor allow him any thing, but to sustain his life in a most slender manner: the third degree,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:34728:83"/> in Chaldee <hi>Scammatha,</hi> was the proper punishment of him, who by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> had deserved death, but, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of capitall Judgement being taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, could not be put to death: his touch and commerce all men shunned. Some such thing seems that to be in <hi>Johns</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, <hi>casting out of the Church,</hi> which <hi>Diotrephes</hi> did, that lov'd preeminence, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. v. 10</note> and assum'd unto himself Dominion.</p>
                     <p>'Tis also a point of Jurisdiction to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate any one from the Priests Office, which <hi>Josias</hi> did to the Schismaticall Priests, only allowing them wherewith to live. So <hi>Theodosius</hi> and other Emperours made decrees about the deposition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Bishops. <hi>Constantine</hi> threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens the contumacious Bishops, and tels them they should be rul'd, by the vertue of Gods servant, that is, saith he, <hi>my self.</hi> For we must note, to the right of the sword it belongs, not only to eject out of that Office, which flows from the Empire of the Highest Power, but from all other Offices of what kind soever.</p>
                     <p>That Jurisdiction about Sacred things, <note place="margin">3. Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction properly so called belongs not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</note> being a part of Empire largely taken, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to the Highest Powers, is very plain. Let us see, whether any Jurisdiction, Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Law being set apart, agrees to the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:34728:84"/> Ministers of holy things: and afterward, we will consider what is given to them by Humane Law. Naturally, the Priests have no Jurisdiction, that is, no Coactive or Imperative Judgement: because their whole Function includes no such thing, in the nature thereof. That Jurisdiction <note place="margin">4. Yet by Law Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive it belongd to them in some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> which the Priests had in the Primitive State of the Naturall Law, they had as Magistrates, not as Priests; for even when the Priesthood was not joynd with the Highest Power, seldome were the Priests without some power. Hence is <hi>Cohen</hi> a name common both to Priests and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; and among many Nations the Custome was the same. For the <hi>Druids</hi> among the <hi>Gauls</hi> were the most noble of that Nation; and among the <hi>Cappado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> as <hi>Strabo,</hi> himself a <hi>Cappadocian,</hi> tels us, the Sacerdotall dignity was next to the Regall, and Kings and Priests were for the most part of the same family. <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> writes, that the German Priests of old, had alone the Power to punish; and among the Romans, that which <hi>Lentulus</hi> said in the Senate, <hi>The Priests are judges</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cic. l.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Attic.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>of Religion,</hi> signifies not only the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of skill, but of power. But the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall Law plainly to the Priests, and principally to the High Priest, as it gave
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:34728:84"/> eminent dignity, so Jurisdiction too, yet under the Highest Power, whether a King or Councill. And 'tis manifest, where neither a King was constituted, nor a Judge, there the High Priest was Prince, as being the most eminent among all, whether Private men or Magistrates. Examples whereof are <hi>Heli,</hi> and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Asmoneans.</hi> That among the Jewes the Sacerdotall Nobility was of prime note, both <hi>Josephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve.

But in the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law, Christ having not given unto Pastors any Dominion or Command, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath he given them any Jurisdiction, that is, coercive Judicature.

This is certaine, when the earthly Powers used not the Right of punishing, God had given them, to purge and defend the Church; what was wanting in Humane ayde, God himself supplyed by Divine assistance. But, as <hi>Manna</hi> ceased, after the people were brought into the promised Land; so, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Emperours took on them the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:34728:85"/> of the Church, whose Office was to punish them that troubled the Church without or within, the forenamed Divine punishments expired. To speak to the purpose, that Divine execution of revenge was properly the Jurisdiction of God not of men, because the whole work was Gods, not the Apostles. God, that he might give testimony to the truth of the Gospell Preacht, as at the Apostles prayers, or presence, and touch, he healed diseases, and cast forth Devils: so, at their impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, commanded men to be vexed with diseases, or seazed on by Devils.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:34728:86"/> himself is called, that application of the Gospel-threats and promises, which is made to particular men. Whereunto Preaching hath the same proportion, as Legislation to Jurisdiction; wherefore by the same figure is the use of the Keys calld Jurisdiction, as the Preaching of the Gospell Legislation. It hath been shewed afore, that Christ, as alone he gives Law to souls, so alone he passeth sentence on them, not only in the end of the world by the last judgement, but in the meane time also by retaining or remitting sins. <hi>He alone,</hi> saith <hi>Ambrose, remits our sins, who alone hath dyed for our</hi> sins. And <hi>Jerome</hi> saith, <hi>As the Priest makes the leprous clean or unclean, so the Bishop or Presbyter binds or looses.</hi> The same Father shews, where he, that useth the Key, erres either <hi>in fact</hi> or <hi>Law,</hi> there the Key is of none effect. 'Tis otherwise in Jurisdiction; for there, what the Judge erring hath pronounced, stands, by reason of his Authority that gives sentence, and passes into a judged case. As then, the Cryer doth not give the sentence, that he declares either rightly or amisse; so the Pastor, in that use of the Keys, cannot properly be said to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Jurisdiction.</p>
                     <p>To the use of the Keys coheres the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription <note place="margin">8. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the works of penance, by way of direction or persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</note>
                        <pb n="161" facs="tcp:34728:86"/> of works of penance; which if it be generall, as that of the Baptist to the Jews, <hi>Bring forth fruits meet for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> and that of <hi>Daniel</hi> to the King, <hi>Break off thy sins by mercy:</hi> or if speciall, as the enjoyning restitution, and open de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of an open offence; it pertains to the annuntiation of the Law, not to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction. But if that be specally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd, which the Divine Law hath not specially defin'd, this belongs not to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, but ought to be refer'd to <hi>Counsell,</hi> by which name it is very often called by the antient writers. Wherefore, as Philosophers, Physicians, Lawyers, and friends also giving Counsell, doe not properly <hi>pronounce sentence,</hi> although oft times the Counsell is such as cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great fault, be rejected: so neither doth the Pastor pronounce sentence, or use Jurisdiction when he affords advice wholesome for the soule.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, it is annexed to the use of the <note place="margin">9. Non-exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> Keys (which also hath some appearance of Jurisdiction) not to exhibite unto cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine persons the seals of Divine grace. But, as he that Baptizeth, or gives the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist</hi> (as the old manner was) into the mouth or hand of the receiver, exerciseth not Jurisdiction, but only a Ministeriall
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:34728:87"/> act: so likewise, he that abstains from the same actions. Nor is any difference here between <hi>visible</hi> and <hi>vocall</hi> signs. By what right therefore a Pastor declares in words to a man openly wicked, that he is an Alien from the grace of God; by the same right he forbears to exhibite Baptisme to him, it being a sign of the Remission of sins; or if he be Baptiz'd, the Eucharist, it being a signe of Communion with Christ. For the signe is not to be apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, to whom the thing signified belongs not, nor is a Pearl to be cast to Swine, but (as in the Churches was wont to be proclaimed by the Deacon) <hi>Holy things are for holy persons.</hi> Yea, it is not only against verity, but against charity too, to make him partaker of the Holy Sacrament, <hi>that discerneth not the Lords</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29.</note>
                        <hi>body; for he eateth and drinketh damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to himself;</hi> Here then, seeing the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor only suspends his own act, not exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth any right of Dominion over the acts of other men, it appears, these things perteine to the use of liberty, not the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of Jurisdiction. The like in some proportion wee observe in a Physician, that attending his Hydropic patient, will not give him water when he cals for it, because 'tis hurtfull: or, in a grave man,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:34728:87"/> that will not vouchsafe a debauched man the honour of Salutation: and in those, that avoid the company of men infected with Leprosie, or other contagious disease.</p>
                     <p>We have looked upon the actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">10.

Epist. 68. <hi>Jo.</hi> 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 17</note> unto Pastors; let us come to them, which belong unto the Church, or are common to the Pastor with the Church. First then, <hi>the people</hi> (that we may speak with <hi>Cyprian) in obedience to the Precepts of our Lord, ought to separate themselves from a sinfull Pastor.</hi> For command is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to every one particularly, and to all in generall, <hi>to take heed of false Prophets, to fly from a strange shepheard, to avoid them that cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine.</hi> Secondly, the faithfull are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to decline their familiar conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who, being named brethren, <hi>are Whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, Idolaters, Railers, Drunkards, Gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Heretiques,</hi> making again of godliness, or otherwise behaving themselves inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, against the Institution of Christ. <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw your selves from such, be not mingled with them, turn away from them, eat not with them,</hi> saith the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in sundry places. For such men are (as the Apostle <hi>Jude</hi> speaks) <hi>spots in the love feasts</hi> of Christians. Wherefore when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture makes use of these words, 'tis manifest,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:34728:88"/> no act is signified greater than a private one; for what is the Church here bid to do, but what a Disciple doth, when he deserts an evill Doctor; or honest men doe, when they renounce the friendship or society of their Companions fallen into wickednesse? The words, that afterward came into use, <hi>Deposition</hi> of the Pastor, and <hi>Excommunication</hi> of the Brethren, seem to come neerer to the nature of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but words are to be measured by the matter, not matter by the words. A Church is said <hi>to depose</hi> the Pastor, when it ceaseth to use his Pastorship; <hi>to Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> a brother, when it withdrawes it self from his Communion; in both cases, it useth its own right, taketh away no right from another; and although it doth not that without judgement, (whence also the faithfull are said <hi>to judge those that are</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Having weighed what is of Divine right, let us now see what hath been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, either Canonicall or Legall. This was Canonicall, and sprung from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors Counsell, and the Churches consent,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:34728:88"/> that inquisition began to be made into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons also not manifest; and that such as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained not from their sin, were not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Holy Communion, but after a certain space of time, for it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to doe otherwise, but this way was more expedient both for the lapsed and for others. For the lapsed, that they might the more detest their sin; for others, that the example might deterre them from the like offence. Hence it was, that persons guilty of some grievous crime, first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed their fault for a while without the Temple, and after by severall steps were admitted to the Prayers of the faithfull, and last of all to the Sacred Mysteries. With the like severity did the <hi>Essens</hi> of old chastise the offences of their order, as <hi>Josephus</hi> relates; and at this day the Jewes, being but meerly private men, doe enjoyn penalties to the followers of their sect, that are delinquents. He that hath kill'd a man, standing out of doores proclames himself a man-slayer. To others are appointed ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence, stripes, and exile also; for what is wanting to the Power of the Rulers, is supplyed by the reverence of those that obey.</p>
                     <p>To return to the Christian discipline: that the Institutes thereof were never rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:34728:89"/> as Lawes Divine, appears by this, because 'tis not in the power of man to give a Dispensation or Indulgence then; but it hath been alwayes in the power of Bishops, with respect had to the life of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Conc. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyr. Can.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.</note> Penitents, either to prolong or shorten the time of their penance. Yea, and generally men in danger of death were received to Communion; Which the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod calls an antient and Canonicall Law: which agrees also with the custome of the <hi>Essences</hi> in <hi>Josephus.</hi> And among those, that by Divine Law are forbidden to be partakers of holy things, to wit, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, some are by the Canons kept on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Communion of their own Province; others, the Clergies Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion being interdicted them, are admitted to the Communion of Laicks; and for the same crime a Lay-man is Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, a Clerk put out of office. Besides, <hi>Austin</hi> teaches that Excommunication must be forborn, <hi>if the contagion of sin hath invaded and o'respread the multitude.</hi> Which exception were not to be admitted, were Excommunication grounded only on Divine Law. It appears therefore, many things were added out of Humane consent, which, as long as they were destitute of Imperiall Authority, had not only no force
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:34728:89"/> of compelling, but, saving by consent, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged no man: unlesse perhaps by that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Law, which commands offences to be avoided. In the same manner, as the Canons themselves, did the Judgements given according to the Canons, oblige e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one; for, as to the debate of meaner businesses, the Laicks were appointed by <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle's counsell, for composing of differences: so, in the more weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Clergy were the Judges; unto which judgements, pertains that admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, proceeding from naturall equity: <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an Elder</hi> (that is, a man of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19.</note> faith) <hi>an accusation is not to be received without two or three witnesses.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But after the Emperours embraced <note place="margin">12. Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction granted to Pastors by Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law.</note> Christianisme, then at length to Pastors, as men that perform'd a publick office, was some part of Jurisdiction given. This was threefold, by ordinary Law, by consent of parties, by delegation. By ordinary Law, the Bishops were allowed to judge of things pertaining to Religion. The first that seemeth to have made this Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>Valentinian</hi> the first, whose re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script <hi>Ambrose</hi> cites. Other Emperours <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>Ep.</hi> 32</note> did the like. <hi>Justinian</hi> by his Constitution exempts Ecclesiasticall affaires from the Cognizance of the Civill Judges, and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 89.</note>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:34728:90"/> leaves them to the Bishops. In other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, both Clerks and Laicks pleaded not before the Bishops, but by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. Which Jurisdiction by consent, the Bishops receiv'd from <hi>Constantine,</hi> with so full a Right, that the Cause which the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops had once decided, should be carryed on no further; that is, there should be no appeal from the Bishops sentence. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> it was <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 9.</note> made unlawfull for Clerks against Clerks to run forth to the Secular Tribunal, but first the action was to be examined before him, whom by the advice of the Bishops the parties should have chosen. And yet, if the Clerks did otherwise, the secular Judge wanted not Jurisdiction, but the Clerks were lyable to the penalties of the Canon. First of all the Emperours, <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> circumscribed the rights of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Judges, and commanded, that Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whether by Lay or Clergy, in <hi>Civill</hi> Causes, should only be sued before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop; yet so, that the Bishop might remit the difficult Controversies to the Civill Judges: and he might also appeal to the Civill Judge, that would not rest in the judgement of the Bishop. But the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Clergy for <hi>Crimes</hi> not meerly Ecclesiasticall, at that time, and long after,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:34728:90"/> remained in the hand of the Civill Judges. That which wee have said of the non-appeal from the Sentence of the Bishop chosen Judge by consent of parties, the same, <hi>Arcadius</hi> also, <hi>Honorius,</hi> and <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dosius</hi>

                        </note> doe shew in the Epistle to <hi>Theodorus Manlius Praetorian Praefect: Let the Bishops sentence be firm for all, that have chosen to be heard by Priests; and wee command the same reverence to be given to their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which must be given to yours, from whom it is not lawful to appeal;</hi> For from the <hi>Praetorian Praefects</hi> was no appeal, but if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one said he was oppressed, 'twas lawfull for him to Petition the Emperour. Whence the <hi>Praetorian Praefects</hi> are said to Judge in the Sacred place, that is, the Imperiall; which may be as rightly said of Bishops judging by consent of Parties. The same right is attributed to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arks, to whose cognizance the causes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall were deferr'd, which with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Bishops could find no end. <hi>Against the Sentence of these Prelates</hi> (saith <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sancimus, Cod.

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:34728:91"/> Causes, was alwayes granted an Appeale unto the Emperour, if Judgement were given by the Emperours command; or to the Judge, whosoever he was, if by the Judges Precept. In the name of Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, we comprehend the right of citing Witnesses, of imposing on them an Oath, and binding the party overcome by Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, unlesse Appeal were made; upon whom also execution was done, not truly by the hand of the Bishop (that was not becomming) but by the hand of the Civill Judge. Hence was the Jurisdiction pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called <hi>Audience,</hi> because the Judge himselfe executed not the Sentence.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore, above that, which the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors <note place="margin">13.

The people now, had not only right to avoid an unfaithfull Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor, but such a Pastor by vertue of a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence pronounc'd against him, lost his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall right, and whatsoever he ascribed to it: and, if he attempted any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Sentence, was punisht with rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. So the Pastor now, had not only right to deny the Sacraments, and every one to deny familiarity, to the brother of an irregular life, but it was also unlawfull
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:34728:91"/> for him to approach unto the Church.</p>

The naked use of the Keyes, with that which adheres unto it by Divine right, hath place, no lesse about the King, than about the least of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yea, is so much more necessary about Him, by how more there is in his sin, danger of contagion. Miserable is that Prince, from whom the Truth is concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: and well did <hi>Valentinian,</hi> to exhort <hi>Ambrose, That he should proceed, according</hi>

                        <hi>to the Divine Law, to cure the soules infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</hi> Neverthelesse, they are injurious <note place="margin">18. Under which pretence, cannot be excused seditious Sermons, Which are refel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Scripture, and the objections answered.</note> to the Gospell, who under the name of the Keyes, cover their popular declamations, wherein they openly traduce the actions of the Highest Powers, that are either of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous Interpretation, or not at all known, or not certainly; and with much acerbity inveigh against them before the common people. This is a way to please the people, who being naturally jealous of their betters, lend a willing eare, and an easie faith to such invectives; but 'tis not the way to edifie them. Hence, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, that seditions follow or, which is the next step to Seditions, the Contempt of the Soveraign; nor without reason hath that most wise writer reckoned, <hi>Doubtfull specches of the Prince, among the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of popular Tumults.</hi> A wide difference there is, between the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and the use of the Keyes. The prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Gospel, being to all, is so to be attempered, that it may profit all; and concealing the persons, aimes only at the vices. It is an evill custome, to turn the Pulpit into a Stage, and the sweet voice of the Gospell, into the old reviling Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. The antient Romans censur'd it as an unworthy thing, <hi>to accuse any man in such</hi>
                        <pb n="175" facs="tcp:34728:93"/>
                        <hi>a place, where he might not presently give in his Answer:</hi> as <hi>Cicero</hi> relates. But God, by an edict of his Law, hath especially guarded, not the life only, but the fame of the Highest Powers, when He said, <hi>Thou shalt not speak evill of the Ruler;</hi> Where manifestly, we must understand somewhat more to be forbidden, than what is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full toward private persons; nor is the Law meant of Power abstractly, or the Ruler only, that governs well. <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes that command to the High Priest <hi>Ananias,</hi> one that Judged contrary to the Law. <hi>Saul</hi> had grievously sinned; and <hi>Samuel</hi> in the severity of a Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth Gods wrath against him: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked by <hi>Saul,</hi> to honour him before the Elders and the People, and not to leave him, He denies not the request. <hi>Nathan</hi> accus'd not <hi>David,</hi> guilty of Adultery and Murther, before the people, but comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himself; as it is credible the <hi>Baptist</hi> did to <hi>Herod,</hi> when he told him of his fault. So the antient Bishops and whole Synods, in publick alwayes speak with greatest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, even to the Pagan Emperours, and enemies of the Church, and to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantius</hi> the Patron of Arians. Neither did the Invective Orations against <hi>Julian</hi> come forth in publick, till after his decease.
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:34728:94"/> The Prophets, I confesse, being Divinely inspir'd, did not alwayes observe this Rule. And no marvell, seeing God, who by the ministery of Prophets anointed Kings; who by <hi>Phineas,</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and by others, slew whom he pleased; and did many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things not allowed to private men; He also by the same Prophets set a mark of publick ignominy upon irregular Princes. For what is more true, than that men spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially inspired by God, to fulfill his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, are by him released from the bonds of Law. Wherefore when <hi>Shimei</hi> openly upbraided King <hi>David</hi> with his homicide, <hi>David</hi> to excuse him found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else to say, but, <hi>It may be the Lord</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11.</note>
                        <hi>hath bidden him:</hi> intimating thereby, that only one way there was, to justifie evill language to the King, if God hath given any one some speciall Injunction for it. The Prophets themselves, when they were accused for raising sedition, take their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from nothing else, but a peculiar Command they had receiv'd from God. Truly, I doe not find, the Kings were thus traduc'd by the Priests, whose office was ordinary; as for the example of <hi>Zacharias</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24 20.</note> the son of <hi>Joiada,</hi> in the Gospel, the son of <hi>Barachias,</hi> his Speech aymed not at the King, but all the people; and in a common
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:34728:94"/> fault, he exhorted all to a common repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, moved thereunto by the Spirit of God. This we know; Christ hath granted to them, who have received injury from the Brethren, that, after they had admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the injurious, first alone, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a few, they might in the last place bring the matter to the knowledge of some pious Congregation; Where, by the name <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17.</note> of Congregation or <hi>Church,</hi> learned men, and among them the famous <hi>Beza,</hi> not without reason, understand, not all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but the <hi>Synedry;</hi> for, by the <hi>Septua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gint,</hi> the word is given to every Company: and in <hi>Moses,</hi> by, <hi>all the Congregation,</hi> the <hi>Synedry</hi> of the Seventy Elders is signified, as <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi Solomon</hi> have long since noted. This also we know, that the Corinthian, who had defiled himselfe <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6.</note> with incest, was <hi>censured of many.</hi> We know, that <hi>Timothy</hi> is enjoyned, to rebuke <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 20.</note> them that sin, <hi>before all,</hi> that the rest may fear. Which place seems, by that which goes afore, to be understood of Presbyters that sin, who in the hearing of the other Presbyters were rebuked by the Bishops. But although we understand it generally, it is certain, these indefinite Rules admit their restrictions and limitations according to the quality of the persons. <hi>An Elder,</hi>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:34728:95"/> saith <hi>Paul, rebuke not, but entreat him as</hi>

Adde here, which many have noted, and is congruent to the Custome of the antient Church, that the Prelats of the Church are not to bee reproved before the multitude; how much lesse the King: who is, (as <hi>Constantine</hi> said) constituted by God as it were an universall Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop?</p>
                     <p>Now as ignominious traduction, so all <note place="margin">19. All coaction of the Highest Powers unlawfull.</note> coaction too, against the Highest Power, is unlawfull; because, all right of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling proceeds from it, there is none a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. That which is objected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Uzziah,</hi> is answer'd by interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 26. 20.</note> the text according to the Originall, thus: <hi>And</hi> Azariah <hi>the chief Priest, and all the Priests looked upon him, and behold he was leprous in his forehead, and they made him hasten thence, yea also, himself was compelled to goe out, because the Lord had smitten him.</hi> By the Divine Law, it was not permitted for a leprous man to be in the Temple; the Priests were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earnest in hastning the King away, because he was struck with leprosy, and the disease it self encreasing upon him
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:34728:95"/> made him depart of his own accord, The Priest declares, God compels.</p>
                     <p>We have said what may be done by <note place="margin">20. Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall acts cannot be exercis'd against the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power, without consent.</note> Authority of Divine Right; the rest, that hath been added by the Canons, either naked, or cloth'd with Law, as it may, wee confesse, to good purpose be used upon the Emperour sometimes; so, if he oppose it or forbid, by what right or with what prudence it may be used, we doe not see. For, that all Government, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riseth from consent, is under the Supreme Command, and that all Jurisdiction is not only under it, but also floweth from it, is demonstrated afore; nor is that in question, that the Soveraign is not bound by penall Statutes. Whence the antient Fathers have interpreted that of <hi>David, To thee alone have I sinned,</hi> to be spoken, <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Psal.</hi> 51.</note> because he was a King; whence also is that note of <hi>Balsamon,</hi> to the twelfth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the <hi>Ancyran</hi> Synod. <hi>The Imperiall unction drives away penance,</hi> that is, the necessity of publick satisfaction.

Whether or no it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, that a King should suffer this Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction to be exercis'd upon him, is wont to be disputed. They that affirme, shew how by this submission of Kings, much strength &amp; Authority accrueth to the Discipline of the Church. 'Tis true, and spoken to the purpose, As the Princes, so will the People be; and the Rulers example hath the sweetest influence.

To the former some of the Emperours, before <hi>Henry,</hi> rare examples of Christian meeknesse, have yielded willingly: but <hi>Henry</hi> was the first of all, upon whom any thing so ignominious was imposed, or any thing at all without a voluntary sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. And <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> or <hi>Gregory</hi> VII. was the first of all the Popes, that took upon him so great a boldnesse toward the Imperiall Majesty, as <hi>Onuphrius</hi> tels us; who also saith, that <hi>the Kings and Emperours, who either upon just or unjust cause exempt themselves from these Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive censures, are to be resigned up to the Judgement of God.</hi> And so the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> for many ages, have challenged to themselves this right, That they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be excommunicated.

                     <p> It remains now to shew, what is the <note place="margin">22. What is the Right of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power, about the foresaid acts of Pastors and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</note> Right and Office of the Highest Power, about those actions, which we have as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed unto Pastors and Congregations. And first, as to those actions, which by the only Right of Liberty, and Privilege of Divine Law, are exercised, seeing by them also injury may be done to others, it is certaine, they are comprehended within the sphere of the Supreme Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. For, not only the Actions, which proceed from the Authority of the Highest Power, but all Actions whatsoever, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of externall morall goodnesse or evilnesse, are called to the judgement of the Highest Power. If married persons performe not to each other, what the Law of Matrimony requires; and if the Master of a Family neglect his charge; in these cases, the Courts of Justice are of use. Of all evill, the Power is ordein'd the Avenger. One among evils, and not the least, is the abuse of the Keys, and unjust separation, or denegation of the Sacraments. There is an Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 3. <hi>Cod. de Episc. &amp; Cleric.</hi>
                        </note> Law, prohibiting the Bishop, that hee Sequester no man from the Holy Church, or the Communion, unlesse it be upon just ground. And <hi>Justinian</hi> in his Novell, forbids all Bishops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:34728:97"/> to segregate any one from the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Novel.</hi> 123</note> Holy Communion, before cause bee shew'd wherefore the Sacred Rules will have it to be done. <hi>Mauritius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour commands <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, to embrace Communion with <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople.</hi> In <hi>France,</hi> the antient usage was by seizing on their Lands, and other wayes, to compell the Bishops to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of Sacraments. And the Princes of <hi>Holland</hi> have often layd their Commands upon the Pastors to execute Divine service. Much more then, may the Highest Power challenge this right over such Actions, as have their force, not by Divine, but Canon Law. For, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of Canons, it sometimes happens, that the Canons are violated; and 'tis possible, the Canons themselves may be exorbitant from the Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions. If either be, the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cannot deny the Plantifs, to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the case. Now concerning those actions, which flow from Humane Law, and oblige men whether they will or no, and draw after them coaction, there is much lesse cause of doubt. For all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as it flows from the Highest Power, reflows unto the same.</p>
                     <p>But as it is a part of Jurisdiction, not
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:34728:98"/> only to Judge, but to appoint Judges, so belongs it to the Highest Power to doe both. Thus <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and the other <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19 8. &amp; 11.</note> Priests with him, are constituted Judges by <hi>Jehoshaphat.</hi> Neither can be shewed <note place="margin">22. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall appeals depend on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</note> more evidently, the Jurisdiction of the Supreme in this kind of causes, than that all degrees of appealing depend upon his pleasure. Otherwise, why doe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors of <hi>England</hi> appeale unto this or that Bishop, all the Bishops unto the two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops? And there is the same subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the consistories, Classicall, (as they call them) and Provinciall, and the Nationall Synods. Nor is the last terme of appealing limited by any Law Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall or Divine. Wisely said the King of <hi>Britaine, in his judgement every Christian King, Prince, and Common-wealth have it in their Power, to prescribe unto their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that externall forme of Government in Church affairs, which may suit best with the forme of Civill Government.</hi> And truly, of old, it was so done by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperours. Otherwise, whence came that so great Prerogative of the Constantinopolitan Church? Whence had the Synod of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> power to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogate the acts of the second at <hi>Ephesus?</hi> Now as in Civill businesses, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:34728:98"/> is permitted by the Highest Power, <note place="margin">23. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction by himself or others.</note> for the most part, to the appointed Courts, and at last, upon Petition against the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of them, the matter is referr'd to men most skilfull in the Law; or, more rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Highest Power it self advising with learned Counsell gives finall judgement; but very seldome upon suspition of some Court, cals forth the cause unto it self: so also in these controversies about Sacred things, it hath been most usuall by the ordinary Synods, and, upon appeal from their decree, by a certaine Assembly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for the purpose, to put an end unto them; it hath been lesse usuall, yet some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times usefull, for the Emperour himself to judge of the Religion and equity of the former Judges. Thus in the case of the Donatists, after a double judgement of Bishops, <hi>Constantine</hi> did; who although he approved not the appeale, yet he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused not the tryall of it. But this is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more rare, and yet not without right, that, if a Synod upon probable causes▪ be declined, the Highest Power cals the cause before it self, and weighing the opinions of most eminent Divines, pronounces what is most equitable. The Synod of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 12.</note>
                        <hi>Antioch</hi> prohibits him that complains of injury received from a Synod, to trouble
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:34728:99"/> the Emperour with the hearing of his Case, so long as the matter may be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a greater Synod. Yet this takes not from the Emperour the Power to heare the cause, if it be brought before him. Moreover, the modesty of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Bishops hath attributed Power to Kings, not only to examine the right or wrong of Excommunication, but to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don <note place="margin">24. The Highest Power may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall and Legal penalties; And judg whether Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion bee just or no.</note> also and abate the punishment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for so much as belongs to Positive Law. <hi>Ivo Carnotensis,</hi> a Bishop, and a stout defender of the Churches right a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Kings, was not afraid to write un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his fellow-Bishops, <hi>that he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a certain person into Communion, in contemplation of the Kings favour to him, according to the Authority of a Law, that saith, whosoever the King receiveth into grace, and admits unto his Table, the Priests and Congregation must not refuse.</hi> The Kings of <hi>France,</hi> and the Vindicators of the Regall Right, the Judges of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Courts, have often constituted and decreed, <hi>that publike Magistrates, by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of that Jurisdiction they exercise, are not subject unto those Ecclesiasticall penalties.</hi> So in the Decrees of <hi>Hungary,</hi> of the year 1551. the Ecclesiasticks are forbidden <hi>to send out, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
                        <pb n="187" facs="tcp:34728:99"/>
                        <hi>and permission of his Majestie, any sentence of Excommunication against the Nobles of that Kingdome.</hi> And in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Law of the English it is read, <hi>that none of the Kings Ministers be Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, unlesse the King be first acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it.</hi> Which I see the Princes of <hi>Holland</hi> have thought fit to imitate; for the same was promulged by <hi>Charls</hi> the Fift, by his edict in the year 1540. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse, such use of the Keys as is congruent to Divine Law, and such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of penance as is consentaneous to the Laws and Canons, the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are wont to approve. And this is the Imperiall <hi>Anathema</hi> mentioned in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of <hi>Justinians</hi> Laws. We conclude, that Christian Powers at this time, doe not innovate, which will not, unlesse upon causes approved by themselves, suffer Excommunication, being joyned with publick shame, to proceed unto effect; which by their command inhibit censures manifestly unjust; for it is their Duty, to save every one from injury, and to keep the Church from Tyranny.</p>

                     <argument>
                        <p>Of the Election of Pastors.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>REmains that part of Empire, which, as we have said, consisteth in assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Functions. The perpetuall Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <note place="margin">1. Two perpetuall functions, of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons; And their difference.</note> in the Church are two, of <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Presbyters, with all the antients, I call them that feed the Church, by preaching of the Word, by Sacraments, by the Keyes; which by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law are individuall. Deacons, which in some sort serve the Presbyters, as the Levites did the Priests of old. To this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are referr'd the <hi>Readers,</hi> who were in the Synagogues, as the Gospel and <hi>Philo</hi> shew, and were retained in the Church, as appears by History, by the Canons, and by the writings of the Fathers. In the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, he that keeps the Book is call'd <hi>the Minister,</hi> which is even all one with <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con:</hi> and the same appellation is given by the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> to the Deacons of Inferiour degree, which were afterward called <hi>Subdeacons.</hi> But the most laborious part of Deaconship is about the care of the poore. <hi>Presbyters,</hi> the antient Latin Church translated <hi>Seniors. Deacons,</hi> I think, cannot otherwise be stil'd, than <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters:</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:34728:100"/> although there be some, who, as their manner is in other things, had rather carp at this, than acknowledge it to be true. I am deceiv'd, if <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> did not understand both Greek and Latin; yet he, relating the Institutes of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, rendring word for word, names them Shee-Ministers, whom <hi>Paul</hi> entitles Shee-deacons, and the Church afterward <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conesses.</hi> Now, as the Levites could doe nothing, but the Priests might do the same; so is there nothing in the Deacons functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is excepted from the function of the Presbyter: because the Deacons were given to the Presbyters as Assistants in lesser matters. Before Deacons were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, one of the Apostles, <hi>Judas Isca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> was Treasurer of the Lords mony; and after him, all the Apostles for some time distributed their allowance among the poor, untill the contention risen among the Widows, and the greatnesse of their other employments enforced them to use the help of others. And yet, the Institution of Deacons did not so acquit the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but they had still the poor under their inspection. Hence were the Bishops chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trusted with the dispensation of the Churches mony, and that with so full a Power, as to be unaccountable, but to use
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:34728:101"/> part of it for the necessities of themselves and other men, and to deliver part to the Presbyters to be disposed among the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>C.</hi> 38. 40. 41. <hi>C.</hi> 44.</note> poor: as appears in the Canons which are entitled Apostolicall, and in the Synod of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Unlesse the antient Custome had been so, in vain had the Apostle comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a Bishop to be hospital; in vain had the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Collections been deliver'd to the Presbyters at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now concerning the Constitution of Presbyters, whose function is principall <note place="margin">2. These four di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, Mandate. Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Election. Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</note> and most necessary, we must note four things that by many writers are not accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enough distinguished; The first is, the faculty it self of preaching, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring the Sacraments, and using the Keyes, wich we will call the <hi>Mandate;</hi> a second thing is, the application of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to a certain person, which by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived word we will stile <hi>Ordination;</hi> a third is, the application of this person unto a certain place or Congregation, which is called <hi>Election;</hi> the fourth is that, whereby a certain person in a certain place exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Ministery under the publick prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and with publick Authority; and let us call this, if you please, <hi>Confirmation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first is to be distinguished from the second. To illustrate this with a <hi>Simile▪</hi>
                        <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34728:101"/> The Husbands power is from God; the application of that Power unto a certain person proceeds from consent; whereby yet the right it self is not given. For, if it were given by consent, by consent also might Matrimony be dissolved, or agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made that the Husband should not rule over the Wife; which is not true. The Imperiall Power is not in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; therefore they doe not give it: yet they doe apply it to a certain person. The Power of life and death is not in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, before they joyn together in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; for a private man hath no right unto the Sword: yet by them it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied unto a Senate, or single person. Christ, without controversie, is He from whom that right of Preaching, of exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacraments, and of using the Keyes, doth arise and receive its vertue. He also by his Divine providence, as he preserves the Church, so procures, that the Church may not want Pastors.</p>
                     <p>The second differs as much from the third, as for a Physician to be Licensed to practice Physick, and to be chosen Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian to such a City: or, for a Lawyer to be admitted to the honour of that Profession, and to be made a Syndic of some Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. These two have been ever distinct,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34728:102"/> and sometimes separate. The Apostles were truly Presbyters, and so they call themselves; for the greater Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the lesse; yet was not their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction appropriate to any certain place. The Evangelists also were Presbyters, but to no place bound. And so long after, was <hi>Pantaenus</hi> ordained by <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Bishop of <note place="margin">3. Of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination without a Title.</note>
                        <hi>Alexandria; Frumentius,</hi> by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and were sent to preach the Gospell through <hi>India;</hi> Which in our time hath been also done; and would it were done more carefully. Indeed the 6. Canon of the Synod at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> forbids Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on absolutely, or, <hi>without a title;</hi> but this is not of Divine Law or perpetuall, but positive, and such as admits exceptions. The reason of the Cannon was, lest by too great a number of Presbyters the Church shal be burdened; or, the Order it self grow cheap, and vile. The <hi>London</hi> Synod excepteth fellowes of Houses in both Universities, and Masters of Art li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving upon their own means, and who are shortly to undertake some cure. If the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop ordain any other, 'tis at his own perill, to keep them from want, untill they are provided for. Therefore <hi>Election,</hi> that is, assignation of a certain place, and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> are not alway joyn'd together, and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:34728:102"/> when they are, they are not the same.</p>
                     <p>Which is farther proved, because they that are translated from place to place, must be chosen again, but not again ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which they must be, if either Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Ordination were the same, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination a part of Election. Besides, it will appear that Election was made by men of sundry sorts, but Ordination only by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, <note place="margin">4. Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22.</note> and antiently by Bishops only. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the first Bishop of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> gives him Admonition, <hi>That he lay hands on no man suddenly.</hi> And the most antient Canons entituled Apostolical, require, <hi>that a Presbyter be ordained by a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, but a Bishop not without two or three Bishops.</hi> Which Custome, it seems, came from the Hebrews: for the Senators of the Great Synedry could not be ordain'd, but <hi>by three Priests;</hi> and that <hi>by imposition of hands,</hi> as is noted by the Talmudists. Without question, this manner was most holy, and for the conservation of sound Doctrine most commodious: when none was admitted to teach the people, but he first receiv'd Allowance from the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Doctors of the same Faith. Pastors therefore ought to ordain Pastors; nor is this their office, as they are Pastors of this or that Church, but as Ministers of the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34728:103"/> Church Catholick. For, saith <hi>Cyprian, There is but one entire Episcopacy, whereof every one is a partaker.</hi> Hence it hath been alwayes held, that the Baptism is of force, given by a Presbyter without the limits of his peculiar Charge.</p>
                     <p>Nor is it materiall, whether the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on precede the Ordinarion, or be conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it; for, when it precedes, it is a conditionate, not plenary Election: which the Canons of later times have called <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation.</hi> Over this Ordination the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">5. The H. Power hath Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over it.</note> Power hath an Imperiall inspection and care. <hi>Justinians</hi> Constitutions are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, <hi>of the Ordination of Bishops and Clerks;</hi> and other Lawes of others, which prescribe the age and standing of men to be ordained. Lawes of good use, and fit to be reviv'd for the prevention of the Churches ruine, through the rawnesse and ignorance, and inexperience of her Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: according to that out of the old Poët:</p>
                     <q>
                        <l>What lost your state, founded on so good Rules?</l>
                        <l>The publick charge was given to boyes and fooles.</l>
                     </q>
                     <p>The fourth member of our distinction, <hi>Confirmation,</hi> differs as much from the third, as the Church considered by it self, differs from the Church publick. 'Tis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent here, that <hi>Ezechiah</hi> is read to have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34728:103"/>
                        <hi>Confirmed the Priests;</hi> that Pastors are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 29. 3.</note> by Lawes and Armes; that some Jurisdiction or <hi>Audience</hi> is attributed to them; that Maintenance is assigned them, out of the publick, either lands or moneys; that Vacation from civill offices, and in some causes exemption from the Court of Inferiour Judges is indulged to them. All which shewes, that their publick <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is by the favour of the H. Power; as the <hi>Institution of their Office</hi> is from God, their <hi>Ordination</hi> by the Pastors. Only there remaines to be disputed their <hi>Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that is, the Application of the Person to the Place, or of the Place to the Person.</p>
                     <p>That we may handle this question ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, we must have recourse to that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 7.</note> set down afore. Some things are <note place="margin">6. Right Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Mutable.</note> of immutable right; other things are just and right, untill it be constituted otherwise. In this later way; not in the former, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a Pastor, in any place whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, belongs to the Church or Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithfull in that place. That the Election is rightly made by the Church, is proved by the very Law of Nature; for, naturally every Society is permitted to procure those things, which are to their own conservation necessary; in which number, is the Application of Functions.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:34728:104"/> So have the Company in a ship, a right to choose the Master; Fellow-Travellers their Leader; a free people their King. Whence it follows; if the Divine Law <note place="margin">7. How the Election of Pastors belongs to the Church.</note> hath not prescribed a certain way of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and as yet no Humane Law thereof is extant, then the Election of their Pastor pertains unto the Church.</p>
                     <p>But he that will affirm this Right to be immutable, must evince the immutability, either by the Law of Nature, or by the positive Law of God. By the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he cannot: for no reason persuades it, and like examples shew the contrary. So, many Nations, who are under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the best men, or of hereditary Kings, may not now Elect their King; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, that which Nature did permit, might be chang'd by Humane Law, and hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been chang'd. He must then have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Positive Law, which he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to produce. Examples in stead of Law, hee must not allege; for many things are rightly done, which yet are not necessary to be done. Nay more, not only <note place="margin">8. Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions subject to change.</note> many things, grounded upon examples of the Apostles time, but also some things Instituted by the Apostles, use hath alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: to wit, such things, which were not strengthned by the force of a Law. The
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:34728:104"/> Apostles Instituted, that the Churches should have Deaconesses: which <hi>Pliny</hi> also shewes to have been among the Christians in his age. What Church is there now, wherein this Office is retain'd? And <hi>Beza</hi> saith, he sees no cause, why it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd. The same <hi>Beza</hi> acknowledgeth, the Function of the Deacons to have been perpetuall, by Apostolicall Institution; who neverthelesse approves the different usage of <hi>Geneva.</hi> The Apostles Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that Baptism should be celebrated by immersion, which by aspersion is now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd. Many other things of like sort, need not be prov'd abrogated, seeing they are prov'd to have been used, they are not prov'd to have been commanded. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it appears not out of the whole Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the New Testament, that Pastors <note place="margin">9. Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, but not Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note> were Elected by the people: that the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Election remained indefinite, is more easily collected thence. I speak of Pastors; for, of the receivers of the Churches mony, there is not the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The Apostles were very sollicitous, lest by taking of the publick mony they should incur suspicion, or give offence. <hi>Paul</hi> might assume <hi>Luke</hi> unto himself, by his Apostolicall Power, and commit to him the custody and disposition of Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:34728:105"/> for the poor: but he chose rather, to permit a free election to the Churches; for this reason, as himself speaks; that no man should blame him, in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 20</note> of so copious munificence. For the like cause, was the election of Deacons, remitted by the Apostles to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that no man should complaine of any partiality between the <hi>Hebrews</hi> and the <hi>Hellenists.</hi> But this was not perpetuall, the reason thereof being temporary; for in the next times after the Apostles, the Deacons were not chosen by the people, but by the Bishops; the people being some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <note place="margin">10 Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles time ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Holy Spirit, And <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias</hi> the Apostle. <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 70. 13. 18. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1.</note> consulted with, and sometimes not.</p>
                     <p>To proceed with the Pastors: the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of them, the Apostles, were elected by God the Father, and by Christ. <hi>I have chosen you twelve: I know, whom I have chosen,</hi> saith Christ. <hi>After that He through the Holy Ghost had given Commandements unto the Apostles whom he had chosen,</hi> saith <hi>Luke.</hi> Paul <hi>an Apostle, not of men, nor by men, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> So, them that were in the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to Apostles, the LXX. Evangelists, Christ himself <hi>appointed.</hi> This Divine <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 1.</note> Election to Preach the Doctrine, then first brought down from Heaven, is signified by the word of <hi>sending;</hi> for, after the

                           <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 15.</note> Preach, unlesse they bee <hi>sent?</hi> When Christ was ascended into Heaven, the promised Comforter supplyed his place. Therefore, both to the ambulatory, and to the standing Offices, the fittest men were chosen, by the judgement and testimony of the Spirit, but by the Ministry of the Apostles, or of them whom the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles had made Governours of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. So <hi>Timothy</hi> was admitted to his <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 18.</note> charge <hi>according to the prophecies which went before on him:</hi> that is, saith <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, by Divine revelation: not by Humane suffrage,</hi> saith <hi>Chrysostomo.</hi> And <hi>Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menius</hi> generally of that age, <hi>By appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Spirit were Bishops made, not in a common way.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> in his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> tels them, <hi>They were made Overseers over the</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Lords flock by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Sometimes also, Lots were cast, that the people might, by the event, be certified of the Divine judgement. The most antient Authour, <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> hath left this written of <hi>John</hi> the Apostle, <hi>By Lot, He chose the Clergy, of those that were signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit.</hi> Nor is it a new thing to
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:34728:106"/> use Lots in the choice of Priests, but used also by the Gentiles, by the antient insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, doubtlesse, of the sons of <hi>Noah.</hi> This illustrates the History of <hi>Matthias:</hi>

What is said, <hi>They appointed two</hi> Barsabas <hi>and</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thias, ought not to be referr'd unto the multitude, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> would have it, but, as it is the common opinion of the Fathers, to those eleven, whose names are afore exprest, and who by the mouth of <hi>Peter</hi> had spoken to the multitude. These are they, who in the words immediatly following are said <hi>to have powred out their prayers unto God,</hi> and <hi>to have given forth their Lots,</hi> that it might appeare, not, whom the multitude, but <hi>whom God had chosen:</hi> for so themselves speak; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that which follows, is not to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>He was chosen by the suffrages of all:</hi> (for who can believe, that the people were call'd to give their votes, after the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine election, unlesse Gods pleasure ought not to stand, without their good liking:) but, <hi>He was numbred with the eleven A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles,</hi> as the <hi>Syriac</hi> and all the antients have interpreted.</p>

                     <p> So, there is another word in the <hi>Acts,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">11. Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons not proved by. <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 23.</note> wherein some are more subtile, than is necessary. The Apostles are said to have commended the faithfull <hi>Lycaonians</hi> to God, with prayer and fasting, after they had <hi>ordained</hi> them Presbyters in every Church. This ordaining is expressed by a Greek word, in whose Etymology some have found the suffrages of the people. And 'tis true, that both at <hi>Athens</hi> and in the Cities of <hi>Asia</hi> there was a Custome of giving suffrages with the hand stretched forth. And if we were delighted with that subtilty, 'twere easy to interpret the word of the Apostolicall Imposition of hands or Ordination, for he that imposeth hands must needs stretch them forth; and the next writers after the Apostles use the word in this sense. But indeed, neither the Evangelists, nor other Greek Authors are so curious in their words; yea there is scarce any word which hath not enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged its signification, beyond the originall meaning. Againe, if <hi>Luke</hi> in this place would have signified a popular election, he would not have ascribed the word, <hi>ordained,</hi> to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as hee doth, but to the multitude. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> doe the same thing here, which in another place <hi>Paul</hi> would
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:34728:107"/> have <hi>Titus</hi> doe, that is, <hi>ordaine Presbyters in</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5.</note>
                        <hi>every City.</hi> That which <hi>Titus</hi> is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe, by the precept of the Apostle, the same doth the Apostle here, being so authoriz'd by the Spirit of God, that he needed not the assistance of the people. Lastly, the fasting and prayers did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the Ordination, but intervened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Valediction; that it is strange, this should be drawn into an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of popular election, when as, if the prayer and fasting of the people had prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, this were nothing to the purpose. For, the people may also fast and pray to God, that the election of a King to be made by the Electors, may be prosperous and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; yet are not the people therefore the Electors.</p>
                     <p>I have seen them, who would assert <note place="margin">12. Nor by the precept of avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding false Teachers.</note> Election to the people by Divine and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable right, upon this ground, that the people hath from God a precept to avoid false Pastors. But these men doe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that this argument, if it have any force, proves Election to be the right not of the multitude only, but entirely of every single person. For all, and every one, must avoid false Pastors, with all care. And so must every sick man take heed of a rash Physician: but no man will therefore say,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:34728:107"/> that the City Physician is to be chosen by the <hi>Plebeians.</hi> This may rightly be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected thence, before election can come unto effect, the people, and every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <note place="margin">13. The old way of trying Pastors in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</note> the people, must have power to allege causes, if they have any, wherefore he, that is proposed, ought not to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. For <hi>Paul</hi> having spoken of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, and passing unto Deacons, saith, <hi>And let these also first be proved,</hi> where, <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 10.</note> requiring that to be observ'd in Deacons, which was to be observ'd in Bishops, there is no doubt but he would have Bishops to be proved, especially seeing he said afore, that they must be <hi>blamelesse.</hi> Among the <hi>Athenians,</hi> there was a probation of their Princes, the forme whereof was this: What <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pollux l.</hi> 8.</note> Parents and fore-Fathers they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted from, of what tribe they were, of what estate, what service they had done the Common-wealth. So, if a Pastor were to be elected, it was justly granted every one to enquire, what his behaviour was, how married, what his children were, and the rest which <hi>Paul</hi> would have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in a Pastor. This is that in the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon, Let the name of the</hi>

                        <hi>ordained be publisht;</hi> for so <hi>Lampridius</hi> hath exprest it, in the life of <hi>Alexander Severus: When he appointed Governours</hi>
                        <pb n="204" facs="tcp:34728:108"/>
                        <hi>of Provinces, he publisht their names, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting the people, if they had any thing against them, they should bring in their evidence; for, he said, it was a great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vamen, not to doe that in choosing Rectors for Provinces, which the Christians and Jews did, in publishing the names of such as are to be ordain'd.</hi> This is indeed a Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent Testimony of the old fashion of Christians, not much distant from the Apostolicall time. For between the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease of <hi>Jobn</hi> the Apostle, and the Reign of <hi>Severus,</hi> are about a hundred years and ten. But this place is so far from evincing the Christian Priests to have bin chosen by the people, that hence you may rather conclude the contrary. For 'tis one thing to be admitted to prove crimes or impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, another thing to elect. <hi>Severus</hi> did propose unto the people the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours names: but that they were elected by the Emperour himself, no man, that hath read History, will doubt. Yea, 'twas needlesse to propose the Priests unto the people, if the people did elect them. It is most certaine, in the antient Church, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apostles age, although by right the people might choose their Pastors, that was not every where observ'd, but the people abstained very often from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:34728:108"/> by reason of the incommodities of popular Voting, retaining in the mean time the right of probation. And this is the <note place="margin">14. <hi>Cypriaen</hi> doth not confirm, but ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> sense (if it be rightly weighed) of <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Epistle to those of <hi>Spain;</hi> wherein some lay the chiefe foundation for Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the people; for he doth not precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, <hi>The people have power of choosing worthy Priests,</hi> but either <hi>of choosing worthy, or refusing the unworthy.</hi> Either is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s purpose, <hi>that an unworthy person may not creep into the place of a Priest.</hi> And in the following words, hee doth not say, a Priest is to be chosen by the people, but <hi>the people being present.</hi> Why so? <hi>that a fit and worthy person may be approv'd by the publike testimony and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> And a little after, <hi>that the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, either the crimes of evill men may be detected, or the merits of good men commended.</hi> How so? <hi>Because the people most perfectly knowes the life of every one, and hath best experience of his conversation.</hi> Neverthelesse, the same <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the same place declares, that, to choose a Bishop in the presence of the people was not a thing of universall Custome. <hi>It is held,</hi> saith he, <hi>among us, and in all the Provinces, almost.</hi> How weak the arguments are, which he allegeth out of Scripture, to
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:34728:109"/> prove the peoples presence necessary, hath been shew'd by others. And the cause he brings hath hardly place, but where the Pastor of a City is to be chosen out of the people or Clergy of the same. But, that Elections were not alwayes made by the people, appears even out of <hi>Cyprian</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in another Epistle, which is likewise thought to favour popular suffrages. <hi>In Ordinations of the Clergy, most dear bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, we are wont to consult with you afore, and by common advise to weigh the manners and merits of every one: but humane Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells are not to be waited for, when the Divine suffrages doe lead the way;</hi> Aurelius <hi>our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, an illustrious young man, is already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by our Lord, and called by God,</hi> &amp;c. And then, <hi>Know ye therefore, most beloved brethren, that He was ordained by me, and my Collegues that were present.</hi> He saith, He was wont to consult with the people; that they were alwayes to be consulted with, he saith not: yea, by his example he shewes the contrary; for He with his Bishops had promoted <hi>Aurelius,</hi> the peoples advise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not required. Hee setteth down the cause: the people is advised with, to give testimony of life and manners: but <hi>Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> had a sufficient testimoniall from his twofold Confession, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> calls <hi>a</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:34728:109"/>
                        <hi>Divine suffrage.</hi> By the same right, Hee declares to his Clergy and people, by epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, that <hi>Numidicus</hi> was to be ascrib'd to the number of the Carthaginian Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that he had design'd the like ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for <hi>Celerinus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That in <hi>Africa</hi> other Bishops also had <note place="margin">15.

                        <hi>approved, by the testimony either of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or of the people.</hi> Wherefore, two wayes lead one to the Clergy, Popular te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, or Episcopall examination. Whence <hi>Jerom</hi> to <hi>Rusticus; When you are come to perfect age, and either the people or the Prelate of the City shall elect you into the Clergy.</hi> And in another place; <hi>Let Bishops hear this, who have power to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Presbyters through every City.</hi> Yea, the <hi>Laodicean</hi> Synod, whose Canons were approved by a Councill Oecumenicall, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth popular Eelections: Upon which place <hi>Balsamon</hi> notes, that the most antient
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:34728:110"/> Custome of popular Elections was abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by that Canon, for the incommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thence arising: as he also notes upon the xxvi. of the Canons Apostolicall, that Presbyters were of old▪ chosen by suffrages, but that custome was long since expired.</p>
                     <p>Now let us proceed to the Election of <note place="margin">16. The Election of Bishops By the Clergy; By the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Bishops.</note> Bishops, a thing of so much more moment, than the former, by how much more care of the Church was imposed on the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, than on the meer Presbyters. No man denies them to have been chosen by the people, that is, by the Laity and the Clergy, after the Apostles time: but, this to have been of right immutable, no man can affirm. For, to passe by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of them that have been constituted Successors by the deceasing Bishops; it is a thing of most easie proof, that Bishops were very often chosen, either by the Clergy of their City alone, or by the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of their Comprovinciall Bb. For the right of the Clergy, the place of St. <hi>Jerom</hi> is remarkable: <hi>At Alexandria, from</hi> Mark <hi>the Evangelist, unto</hi> Heracles <hi>and</hi> Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius <hi>the Bishops; the Presbyters alwayes na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med one to be Bishop, chosen out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and placed in a higher degree. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzen</hi> speaks ambiguously; He would
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:34728:110"/> Elections were permitted, either to the Clergy alone, or chiefly to them; for so lesse evill would befall the Churches: yet withall he shewes, this was not observ'd in his time, but the suffrages of the richest and most potent men, yea, the Votes of the people too, had the stroke in Elections. But, the Election made by the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Bishops is approved by the great <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, without any mention of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 4.</note> the people. Whereunto agrees the <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chian,</hi> adding this, If any contradicted <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Can.</hi> 19.</note> such Election, the suffrages of the greater part of Bishops should carry it. Yet I deny not, in many places, even in the time of these Synods, the people also had their Votes: but the custome was not universall. It was free, untill the Synod of <hi>Laodicea</hi> was confirmed by an Universall Councill: the xii. Canon whereof, following the <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cene</hi> and <hi>Antiochian,</hi> gives the right of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to the Comprovinciall Bishops: the xiii. expresly takes away all Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Elections from the multitude. <hi>Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> also hath excluded the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from the Election of Bishops, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it namely to the Clergy, and the prime men of the City. By the prime men he means the Magistrates and Officers. Among many named, the designation of
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:34728:111"/> one he committed to the Metrapolitan: yet so, that, if there were a scarcity of able men, the Election of one, by the Clergy and principall men, might stand. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this Constitution of <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> (which did not long outlive him,) soon after, there was a return to Synodicall E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections: which <hi>Balsamon</hi> relates were usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in the East in his time also; with this exception, that the Metrapolitans were chosen by the Patriarchs, the Patriarchs by the Emperours.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore we conclude, it is neither pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <note place="margin">17. Muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Election.</note> out of the Scripture, nor was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd by the antient Church, that the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either of Presbyters, or of Bishops, did immutably belong unto the people. Of this judgement also, they must needs be, whosoever have transferred the Election to the Presbytery; for, were it of Divine and immutable right that the Multitude should Elect, the election could not be transferred to the Presbytery, more than to any others. Neither were the Compro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of any value, which we read was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made concerning Election, if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Divine Precept, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people must choose the Pastor; for that sentence, <hi>What a man doth by another, hee seems to doe by himself,</hi> pertains only to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:34728:111"/> those actions, whereof the next efficient cause is undetermined by Law. Certainly, the very same thing, that wee say, was judg'd against <hi>Morellius</hi> at <hi>Geneva,</hi> that is, in that City, wherein great honour, great right belongs unto the people; which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, the most learned <hi>Beza</hi> defending, <hi>That the whole multitude,</hi> saith he, was call'd together, and gave their Vote, was neither essentiall, nor perpetuall. In the same place, he thinks it sufficient, if the common people be allowed to bring in reasons, why they are displeas'd at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, which reasons afterward are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be examin'd. <hi>Beza</hi> himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Election to the Pastors and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of the City; which is congruent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to <hi>Justinian</hi>'s Law, but is not of right Divine and immutable; for how can that be prov'd if Ordination and Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation be rightly distinguisht from Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the antient Church was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, permitting to the Bishop the Election of Presbyters, and of the Bishop to the Comprovinciall Bishops. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the manner of Election is of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <note place="margin">18. In E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power hath a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative right.</note> of those things, that are not specially determined by Law Divine, but only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der generall Rules, which command all things to be done in the Church <hi>for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:34728:112"/> in the best order, and without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion. But in all things of this nature, those generall rules remaining safe, wee have demonstrated afore, Legislation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the Highest Power. <hi>Bullinger,</hi> a man of a very sharp judgement, is of the same mind, who having alleged many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of popular Election, inferrs thus; <hi>Yet I will not thence conclude, that the right</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 2. <hi>de E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisc. Ord. &amp; Instit.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>of electing Bishops, is to be reduced to the promiscuous Votes of the common people; for, whether it be better, that the Bishop be design'd, at the meeting of the whole Church, or by the suffrages of a few, no right Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution can be prescribed to all Churches: for severall Countries have severall Laws, Customes, and Institutes. If any in whom the right is, abuse it by Tyranny, they are compelled into order by the Holy Magistrate, or the right of designing Ministers may be transferr'd from them to others: for it is sufficient, that some Elders performe that office of Electing, upon command of the King or Magistrate, by the advise and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of men who understand what the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Bishop is▪ what is the condition of that Church or People, over which a Pastor is to be appointed; who also can judge of the endowments, the learning and manners of every one.</hi> By this right, <hi>Justinian,</hi> as we
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:34728:112"/> have said, Constituted a manner of Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, somewhat receding from the former usage, and the antient Canons; by this right, after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, were many Bishops elected by the Clergy and the People. The Lawes of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> and other Kings, are extant, containing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers wayes of Electing, so that <hi>Bucer</hi> said most truly, <hi>The form of Election is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by pious Princes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now consider, whether the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <note place="margin">19. And may it self make Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on just cause.</note> Power it self may make Election: the question is not, whether it ought to make it; nor, whether it be alwayes expedient to doe so; but, whether, if it doe make Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, it commit any offence against the Law Divine. We say, with the excellent <hi>Marsilius Patavinus, The Law-giver or Prince is not, by any Law of God, prohibited from the Institution, Collation, or Distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ecclesiasticall offices.</hi> Whosoever affirm the contrary, doe accuse of impiety, innumerable pious Princes of antient and of this age; which truly is a point of great temerity, when no Divine Law can be produced to prohibit it, as hath been abundantly by others, and by us in some part demonstrated. Although this might suffice (for whatever is not circumscrib'd by Divine Law, is within the sphere of the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:34728:113"/> Highest Power:) yet, for the defending of our sentence, both reasons and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are in readinesse.</p>
                     <p>The first reason is taken hence, that all <note place="margin">20. This proved by reason;</note> actions, even those that naturally belong to others, not having causes determined by nature, we see are rightly exercised by the H. Power. Naturally men choose teachers for their children, and give them Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; sick persons make use of what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician they please; Merchants elect the Curators of their Company: Yet in many places, Guardianship is appointed by Law alone, or the will of the Magistrates; Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians are constituted by publick Order, and Informers of Youth too, with inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of others from the practice of those faculties; and to the Commanies of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants are fit Curators also appointed by the Highest Power, without blame of any any. But, if this right be competent to the Highest Power, over those things, which did belong to every one, much more over those things that belong unto the People; because, the power of the people is devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon it, as all men know, that have any knowledge of the Lawes. That sometimes there may be just causes, why the H. Power should challenge to it self the Election of Pastors, no wise man will deny. For often
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:34728:113"/> errours introduced into the Church against the word of God, cannot be rooted out by other means; often, there is no other way to avoid Schism; often, the suffrages of the Clergy are disturb'd with factions, popular election with seditions; whereof are extant many examples, even of the purer times. Adde in the last place, that the times are now and then so boisterous, that the King will hardly keep the Crown upon his head, except hee have a care, the Pastors may be most obedient and faithfull to him. Verily, all Histories doe witnesse, how dearly the German Emperours paid for their abdica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Imperiall Right.</p>
                     <p>That we may come to Examples, it hath <note place="margin">21. And by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in the state of Naturall Law; And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Moisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</note> been shewed afore, that before the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Law, and afterward among the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons without <hi>Judaea,</hi> Kings themselves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Priesthood, the Divine Law not then forbidding it: at which time, there can be no doubt, the Priesthood might also have been committed by them to others: as we read the Pontifs and Flamens were created by the Kings of <hi>Rome.</hi> But, among the Hebrew people, after <hi>Moses</hi> Law, no man, except of <hi>Aarons</hi> family, could be admitted to the office of a Priest; nor to the service of the Temple, unlesse he were <note place="margin">1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12. 31.</note> a Levit. Hence, is <hi>Jeroboam</hi> justly blam'd,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:34728:114"/> for choosing Priests who were not Levits: for the Law did not allow it; nor was it in the King, to command Sacrifices to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, in any place but the accustomed, which, after <hi>David,</hi> was <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Other Functions, or the places for them, the King might assigne to the Priests and Levits. So were some Levits appointed by <hi>David</hi> for preaching, others for singing. And, that there should be Singers with Harps and other Instruments, was God's precept by the Prophets: as the application of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to the severall offices is every where attributed to <hi>David,</hi> under the name of King; and, after <hi>David,</hi> to <hi>Solomon:</hi> and <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> the King, not the Prophet, by name electeth Priests and Levits, whom he might send forth to the Cities of <hi>Juda</hi> to instruct them. The very same thing that is here debated. For, as some Fathers <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Aug. in Ps.</hi> 44.</note> were of opinion, the right of blood in the Moisaicall Law, is correspondent to the Imposition of hands in the Christian Law. As then, the Hebrew King may apply cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain persons, to a certain office and place, but only such as were of <hi>Aarons</hi> family and Levits; so the Christian King rightly makes a Presbyter or Bishop of a certain City, but of them which are ordain'd, or to be ordain'd. And so did <hi>Nehemia</hi>'s
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:34728:114"/> Lieutenant to the Persian King, leave some Levits in the particular Cities, others hee called forth unto <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Yea, the High Priest attained not that dignity by Succession, but Election of the great Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedry, yet confined unto certain families (which Election seemeth to have been the regall right, when the Kings reigned) the most learned of the Hebrews <hi>Maimonides</hi> hath observed.</p>
                     <p>But let us proceed with the Christians. <note place="margin">22. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and of the Kings of <hi>France.</hi>
                        </note> Before <hi>Constantine,</hi> no man will wonder that no Christian Pastors were elected by the Emperours, when the Emperours ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were enemies to the Church, or had it in contempt, and accounted it not worthy of their care. <hi>Constantine</hi> gave the force of a Law to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon, of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be made by Bishops, other Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours after him did the like, either by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing the Canon, or not abrogating of it. And, 'tis manifest, this manner of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was long in use; the Empire being of greater extent, than that the Emperours diligence could provide for all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Notwithstanding this, it was lawfull for the Emperours, if they pleased, to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect by themselves. For, seeing it is from the Highest Power, that the Canon hath the force of a Law, no marvell, if the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:34728:115"/> Highest Power, upon just causes, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede from that Law, either in the whole, or in some particular case. For Lawes are wont either to be abrogated, or temper'd and limited by the Law-givers, as afore is shewed. Yea, there is no need of abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or solution of the Law, when as the Lawyers agree in this, that, by the generall words in the Law set down, the right of the Highest Power is never conceiv'd to be excluded. 'Tis true, the Examples of Elections made by Bishops prove, it is not necessary that Elections be made by the Highest Power; the Canons also shew, the same Elections are rightly made by Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, with consent of the Highest Power: but neither of these is in question. The Question is, whether it be also lawfull for the Highest Power to make Election. That it is lawfull, we have the judgement of the best, both among the Emperours and the Bishops.</p>
                     <p>In the first Synod of <hi>Constantinople, Theodosius</hi> commanded the names of all that were proposed should be given to him in papers, reserving to himself the choyce of one. What can be more clear? One a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Bishops propos'd <hi>Nectarius:</hi> the Emperour makes choise of him, and persisteth in it, against the will of many
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:34728:115"/> Bishops; who, seeing the Emperour would not be remov'd, give place, and yeild him that reverence, which was due unto him, in a matter not prohibited by Law Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine. Who sees not, this was done beside the Canons? for according to the Canons, the Emperour had no share in the Election, but here the Emperour alone electeth, that is, designs the person. The Bishops, as also the Clergy and people, approve of the Election. But, 'tis one thing to <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> another to <hi>approve</hi> of the Election. The Bishops approve, because it was their Office, after Baptisme, to impose hands upon <hi>Nectarius,</hi> as yet a lay man and Catechumen. And here too, we observe, the Canon was not followed: for accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Canons, a Catechumen, nor Neophite, could not be elected. The Clergy also, and the people doe approve: because to them belong'd the <hi>Tryal;</hi> which, how far it differs from Election is shew'd above.</p>
                     <p>Many examples we might alleage, of Elections not Canonicall, but Imperiall. Why the Emperours themselves elected, we deny not they had peculiar causes; but this pertains not to the question of right, but prudence. Certainly, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours believ'd it to be lawfull for them,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:34728:116"/> before they consider'd whether or no, it were expedient. For of things unlawfull, there ought to be no consultation. To say <note place="margin">23. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections answer'd.</note> the cause hereof was some Divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or inspiration, in such an age of the Church, is a meer refuge of pertinacious ignorance: to say, the Domination of the Roman Bishops, was the cause of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall elections, when as yet that Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy was not turn'd into temporall Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, is to be quite mistaken in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of times. Nor yet can wee doubt, but the more Sanctimony abated in the Clergy, and Obedience was slackned in the people, the more just cause had the Highest Powers to vindicate Election to themselves. In the West, that Bishops were most often, and for a long time, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the most Christian Kings of <hi>France,</hi> without any suffrage of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or Clergy, is written in all the French Histories, as it were with Sun-beams. What was said of the Domination of the Roman Bishops, as if he had given occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Kings to draw to themselves the Elections, besides that it is before answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, cannot be applyed to the Bishops of <hi>France,</hi> and to those times, when the French Kings did not yet possesse <hi>Italy.</hi> Yea, on the contrary, because the French
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:34728:116"/> Kings used this right in their own king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, therefore also in <hi>Italy</hi> did <hi>Charls</hi> the great assume this to himself, that hee might not with lesse power governe <hi>Italy,</hi> than <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> For, it is most truly observed by <hi>Godalstus</hi> and others, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree made in Pope <hi>Adrians</hi> time, pertains only to the Italian Bishops, when in other parts, the compleat right of Election was in <hi>Charls</hi> before. In vaine also, a recourse is had to the wealth of Bishop-pricks, &amp; the Temporall Jurisdictions annexed to them; for even in the times of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, and much more in the antient and purer times, Bishopricks were but poor and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as is noted by that most searching An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, <hi>Onuphrius.</hi> And for Jurisdictions, the Bishops, in <hi>Charls</hi> his time, had none an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to their Bishopricks: but this came into use at last, after the avulsion of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> when the <hi>Ottoes</hi> were Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peronrs in <hi>Germany.</hi> And, the Jurisdictions were so far from being the cause of Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Elections, that, on the contrary, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were Jurisdictions granted unto Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, because the Emperours were most assured of their fidelity, being chosen by themselves, and thought the custody of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might therefore most safely bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them: as the same <hi>Onuphrius</hi> hath
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:34728:117"/> observed. Some have been deceiv'd by the <note place="margin">24. Of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestitures, by them is meant the Collation of Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks.</note> name of <hi>Investiture,</hi> Because the word is used of <hi>Fees</hi> especially, therefore have they thought all that is sayd of investitures of Bishops to belong to territories and Lands; which is a grosse errour; for, <hi>to vest</hi> and <hi>to invest,</hi> are old words of German Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, that signify the collation of any right whatsoever: and are therefore found in old Authors applyed to all Offices both Civill and Ecclesiasticall. It appears by a passage in the life of <hi>Romanus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rouen</hi> about the year 623. that <hi>Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the staffe</hi> was almost 300. years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Territories were given to Bishops; which began under <hi>Otto,</hi> the first Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that name. And truly, if <hi>Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> had been with respect to Civill Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, it would have been by the <hi>Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Sword or Banner,</hi> as the manner of those times was, not by a <hi>ring and staffe.</hi> Wherefore, although the most Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Kings did not challenge to themselves <hi>imposition of hands,</hi> which maketh Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; yet these two things they esteemed as their right, to joyn this man unto this Church, which is signified by the Ring; and to conferre upon him Jurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, that is, judgement concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Sacred affairs with a certaine publike
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:34728:117"/> power, which is signified by the staffe. For to the King himself also, when he was first consecrated, together with the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was wont to be given a staffe. <hi>And by</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>L.</hi> 5. <hi>C.</hi> 50.</note>
                        <hi>this,</hi> saith <hi>Aimonius, the defence of the Churches, that is, a power to maintaine Religion, was deliver'd to him from God;</hi> for the Offices corresponded to the signs: as also a Canon was vested by a Book. Many ages after, when piety had begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten opulency, and the daughter laid a snare for the mother, the Emperours, almost detruded from their most antient right, began to shew the indignity of the thing, by this argument among the rest, because the Bishops by their munificence possessed Lands and territories. But never did the Election of them depend upon this alone, being more antient than the same muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence. Moreover, the accessory cannot have so much force, as to draw the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall after it: and besides, in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, at this time, stipends out of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick succeed in place of Lands: and for all this the right of the Highest Powers remaineth the same it was. Therefore, by the name of <hi>Investiture,</hi> in the stories of those times, is not to be understood a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked sign; nor are Kings to be thought so unwise, that, for a bare rite or Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:34728:118"/> they would have undertaken so many labours, and so many wars: but, with the sign, or by the sign, the thing signified must be conceived, that is, the Collation of Churches. Which Collation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was made two wayes: for, either the Kings by themselves, made Election freely, and without the suffrages of any other; or else, they granted others the right of electing, the right of approving, not imaginary, but with a liberty to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null the Election, being reserved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Both of these, Historians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend in the name of <hi>Investiture.</hi> Which right remained in the Emperours untill the times of <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who first laid violent hands upon it. <hi>Onuphrius Panuinus</hi> relating his life; <hi>He first of all the Roman Bishops attempted to deprive the Emperour, not only of the election of the Pope himself, which also</hi> Adrian <hi>the third had sometimes done; but of all Authority too, whereby he Constituted the other Prelats, to wit, the Bishops and Abbats.</hi> The Author here hath rightly explan'd Investiture by the name of Constitution.</p>
                     <p>Those two things, whereof we said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vestiture consisteth, that is, the power of choosing, and the Liberty of refusing, if the Bishop were chosen by any other, all
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:34728:118"/> writers approved for their dilligence in this kind, have very well distinguished, and knit together in the Regall Right. Such a liberty of refusing I meane, which is not subject to the judgement of another. And indeed these Rights, both of election, and of rejection, are of great consequence, to maintaine both Church and State: but the former, of so much the greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by how much it is more to oblige the receiver of a benefit, then to exclude an enemy. <hi>Paulus Amilius,</hi> when he had declared how that right was extorted from the Emperour <hi>Henry: That thing</hi> saith he, <note place="margin">25. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>much weakned the Imperiall Majestie, in the minds of his people; for he was devested of the better half of his Jurisdiction.</hi> And <hi>Onuphrius</hi> in the same manner: <hi>Half his Power was at once taken from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi> The same Author elsewhere speaks of <hi>Henry</hi> the third: <hi>This most excellent right</hi> (so he cals election) <hi>he retained with all his might.</hi> Of the same mind were the Kings that built their power upon the ruines of the Roman Empire. To let passe others, let us heare, if you please, the King of <hi>England</hi> speak himself. <hi>Henry, the first of that name since the Conquest, granted the Bishoprick of</hi> Winchester <hi>to</hi> William Gif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford; <hi>and presently, against the statutes of</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:34728:119"/>
                        <hi>a new Councill, invested him with the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesions pertaining to the Bishoprick. The same</hi> Henry <hi>gave the Archbishoprick of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury <hi>to</hi> Ralf <hi>Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested him by the ring and staffe.</hi> This is that same <hi>Henry,</hi> who in the relation of <hi>Westminster,</hi> by <hi>William</hi> his procurator constantly alleaged, <hi>that he would not, for the losse of his kingdome, loose the Investi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Churches; and affirm'd the same in threatning words.</hi> Away with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Interpreters of History: who doth not see here that by Investitures is meant the collution of Bishopricks? The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Statute also under <hi>Edward</hi> the third, gives plaine evidence for the same; wherein is manifest, that the Royall Right to collate Bishopricks was in <hi>England</hi> more antient, then the election of the Clergy. And Histories doe give their testimony too: which declare, how Bishopricks, were collated by <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and the most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Kings, seven hundred yeers agoe. Afterward, elections were granted to the Clergy, under two conditions, which were observ'd likewise in <hi>France;</hi> that licence to elect were first obtained, and the election made were submitted to the Kings pleasure. But in the later time the whole election was rendred to the King.
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:34728:119"/> In our time, there is an image of Election in the Chapters; the whole force of it is in the King. For, the Bishoprick being void, the King, by his Letters, containing Licence to elect, transmitteth also the name of him, whom hee would have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bilson</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> discoursing with much diligence upon this Argument, in severall places affirmes that which is most true; <hi>That no particular form of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting is prescribed by Divine Law: and seeing Princes are Heads of the people; and, both by Divine and Humane right, have the charge of all externall and publick admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration, as well in Sacred as in Civill causes, committed to them: these reasons necessarily evince, that the Elections are also committed to their trust; at least, if they bee pleased to undertake the burthen.</hi> The same Author saith, <hi>It is as clear as the Sun, that other Princes, beside the Roman Emperours, since the first profession of Christian faith, not only had the Highest Power in Electing Bishops; but by their sole Authority Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted whom they judged worthy of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, without expecting the suffrages of the Clergy or People.</hi> I will not adde more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples or testimonies: either these are sufficient, or nothing is sufficient.</p>
                     <pb n="228" facs="tcp:34728:120"/>
                     <p> Whosoever therefore, dares to condemn of Sacrilege, so many famous Kings, some whereof, first in their Kingdoms professed the Christian faith; some couragiously re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted the Popes ambition; some either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan or promoted the Churches reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and among them many renowned for their holinesse and learning: whosoever, I say, dare account them sacrilegious, as if in <note place="margin">26. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors as well as Bishops may be E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Power.</note> electing Bictops they had violated the Law Divine, he shall not have me for an approver of his temerarious judgement. Now, whereas some, in this businesse of Election, distinguish the other Pastors from the Bishops, because indeed themselves live where no Bishops are, this difference comes to nothing. For such Pastors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have this common with more Presbyters, that they are not over others; yet have they thus much of Bishops, that they are not under other Pastors; and so 'tis doubtfull, whether they may be rather numbred among more Presbyters, or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. Moreover, seeing Presbyters is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Episcopacy, they that bestow the Bishoprick, do withall bestow the Pastoral cure of a certain place or City, &amp; somthing more: so that, the Argumentation rightly proceeds, as from the greater to the lesse, or rather from the whole to the part. 'Tis
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:34728:120"/> true, the antient Emperours &amp; Kings mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves but little with the collation of Pastorall offices of inferiour degree; the reason was, because they thought in reason, all that lesser care might be rightly cōmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Bishops, chosen either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or according to their Lawes. And therefore, in the most antient Canons, you shal hardly find any thing of the Presbyters election, because all that business was at the Bishops dispose as we have shewed before.</p>
                     <p>Yet are not examples wanting, whereby <note place="margin">27. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</note> it may appear, that Ecclesiasticall offices, of the lesser rank also, were collated by Kings. <hi>Onuphrius</hi> is witnesse for the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. An Epistle of Pope <hi>Pelagius,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome,</hi> is extant, which signifies, that the Sacred Letters of the most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Emperour were come unto his hands, requiring certain men to be made Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Deacon, and Subdeacon at <hi>Centum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</hi> The publick Records of our own Country doe abundantly witnesse, the Princes of <hi>Holland, Zeland,</hi> and <hi>West<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>risia,</hi> even from the beginning of their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, have conferred, at their pleasure, upon fit men, the Pastorall Cure of every City and Village, except in what places it could be proved, that the same right was granted away to others: and that Custome
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:34728:121"/> was kept untill the times of the last War. These examples, although they be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, are yet sufficient to refell those, who have adventured publickly to affirm, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, untill the very last times of the War, were chosen by the People. Here might be added, were it needfull, very many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Investitures, whereby the Princes bestow upon Noble men, their Vassals, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other rights, also the Collation of Churches. And I, for my part, cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, how it comes to passe, that the same right doth not still endure to this day: whether it be expedient, or where, and how farre it is expedient, is another questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The States, in my opinion, by their pains taken in the Reformation, have not deserved to be in worse condition, then before they were. In the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the Pastorall Cures are conferred by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a Senate, which by the cōmand, and in the name of the Elector, hath govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Churches. In the Dominion of <hi>Basil,</hi> the Churches without the City have no power at all in choosing their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor; whom the Magistrate of the City sends to feed them, him they receive with reverence, although they never heard him teach. In the beginning of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were content with this Call a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:34728:121"/> It is the Saying of <hi>Musculus: A</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Loc. Com. de Elect.</note>
                        <hi>Christian Pastor ought not to be sollicitous about his Call, nor to doubt that it is Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and lawfull, where he is called to preach the Gospell, by the pious Magistrate or Prince.</hi> Wherefore the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches doth not deprive the Powers of this Divine Right. Neither have the States themselves ever been of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother judgement; for, when in the year 1586. without the assent of the States, a Synod was held, the Earle of <hi>Lester,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of these parts, to move the States to allow of the Synod, declared <hi>Nov.</hi> 16. That such allowance should be a detriment to no man, in respect of that right he chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged in the Institution of Pastors. And in the same year, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 9. the Acts of that Synod were admitted by the States, with some exceptions, whereof this is one: <hi>That the States, Noblemen, and City-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, and others, should retain the right and Custome of Instituting, and destituting Pastors, and School-masters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let us now give answer to the rest of the Objections, used to be brought against the Highest Powers in this regard. Some say, <note place="margin">28. The Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the abuse of Right, answered.</note> that certain Kings and Princes have abused the Elections, either through a sordid love of gain, or through too much favour. It
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:34728:122"/> is too true; but to the determination of the question, 'tis impertinent; for, the abuse of right depriveth no man of his right; unlesse perhaps a subject, by the sentence of his Superiour; much lesse, is a possible abuse sufficient to the losse of right. Then, no man shall bee certain of any right whatsoever. But to speak the truth, there is a greater number of laudable Elections, which Kings have made. And, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by popular Elections, the matter often was brought unto Seditions and slaughters, to Sword and fire; nor is the Clergy alwayes free from favour and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, no not at this day. So that, if for fear of incommodities Elections may be overthrown, no kind thereof will be able to subsist. When <hi>Genebrard,</hi> an enemy to the Regall right, had said, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> chosen by the Emperours were mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of men, the contrary was shewed by our side, that they were good men, at least in some mediocrity; but from the Election <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Rainold.</hi> 187.</note> of the Clergy and People came forth Monsters indeed. Moreover, the Greatness of the Highest Powers yields not to corruption so easily, as private men, nor is so obnoxious to unjust desires and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Suiters. Lastly, Ordination, which remains with the Pastors, and the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:34728:122"/> right of contradicting, which is left unto the people, shuts up the way, if not to all, which exceeds Humane Power, yet to the worst abuses.</p>
                     <p>The Canons are objected too, and some <note place="margin">29. The Canons and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</note> Sayings of the Fathers. That old Canon, which is the 30. in their number entitled Apostolicall, speaks of Magistrates, not of Emperours; and as the Canon next before is oppos'd to nundinations, so this to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent intrusions. The Canon pertains to them, that being not lawfully examin'd and ordain'd invade the Church by force, by the Magistrates help and favour. So, the <hi>Parisian</hi> Synod disapproves not Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Ordination by the King; nor all the Kings Authority, but that which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of the Metropolitan and Comprovinciall Bishops, to whom the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination did belong. For King <hi>Charibert</hi> himself, under whom this Synod was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, elects <hi>Pascentius</hi> to the Bishoprick of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> whom the Comprovincials re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as rightly chosen, And if the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non bear another sense, yet is it nothing to the purpose. For, if it was made by the Kings consent, it might be rescinded, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himself, or by other Kings also, especially with the sentence of their Peers: because no positive Lawes are immutable;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:34728:123"/> but, if without the Kings consent, then neither had that Canon the force of a Law, nor could the Regall right be impair'd thereby. This is certain, since the Kings began to Elect Bishops, many Synods have been held in <hi>France,</hi> and not any one of them hath reprehended the Kings in that respect, but many have admonished the King, to use that study and care in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Pastors, which was meet. Whence it is evident, the <hi>Gallican</hi> Bis;hops never found any thing in that Election, contrary to the Lawes Divine. 'Tis very improper for our men, to produce the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> second Synod, whereby the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Images was introduced. And yet, the meaning of the Canons alleged thence, is no other, then of those we have already answer'd. That sharp speech of <hi>Athanasius</hi> against <hi>Constantius</hi> is alleged also; Who having received most grievous injuries, if he had uttered any thing, not so generally true, as accommodated to those times, what marvell is it? seeing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fathers too, have let fall many words, which will not bear a rigid Examination. Yet doth not <hi>Athanasius,</hi> how hot soever in this cause, pretend any right Divine, but enquires, <hi>Where is that Canon, that a Bishop should be sent out of the Palace?</hi> He shews,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:34728:123"/> what <hi>Constantius</hi> had done, was not Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall; and rightly; for another way of Electing was then in use, and that confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Authority of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, and by the Precepts of <hi>Constantine.</hi> Now, although for just causes, it be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto Kings, to recede from the Canon; yet to forsake the Canon, with intention of promoting to Episcopacy the favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of the Arrian party, was not the part of a pious Emperour. This way of elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the more justly reprehended, if Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination also being omitted, Bishops were obtruded upon the Churches: which is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credible to have been done; for it was not probable, the Orthodox would ordain Arians, or such as used Collusion with them. Verily, not any one of the Fathers hath hitherto been found, who said, there was any Divine Law to hinder the King from choosing the Pastor. It appears, the most holy Bishops above mentioned, who condiscended to the Election made by <hi>Theodosius</hi> were of another mind. And thus much be spoken of the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers embracing the true Religion.</p>
                     <p>As to the Kings, that give no assent to <note place="margin">30. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Right of Pagan Kings.</note> the saving Faith, pious Assemblies never made addresse, unto them, for election of their Pastors. For how could they expect
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:34728:124"/> defence of the Church from the enemies of the Church. And, suppose the matter should succeed most happily, yet would it be an indecorum, that the Affaires of the Church should be <hi>judged before the unjust,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1.</note>
                        <hi>and not before the Saints.</hi> Yea, if Kings that are aliens from the Faith, arrogate to themselves any such thing, without questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they bring upon themselves the greater Judgement. Notwithstanding, if Infidel Kings will not at all admit any Pastor or Bishop, except <hi>Elected</hi> by themselves, and in the mean time leave to the Church the <hi>Probation,</hi> and to other Pastors the <hi>Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands,</hi> I cannot think it convenient for Christians, to refuse men, otherwise fit, for this only reason, because they are commended by Infidels. For the good God doth effect his good work, even by evill men. I am not a man of that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that I dare condemn so many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Churches in <hi>Thrace,</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> which doe receive Patriarchs or lesser Bishops from the King of the Turks; and that this patience of the Christians is no new thing, is shewed by <hi>Barlaamus Cyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis.</hi> Clearly, 'tis better to entertain a worthy Pastor, adorned with good report of the common People, ordained by other Pastors, from the hand of a Prince, though
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:34728:124"/> an unbeliever, then to suffer the wast of Churches. <hi>Esdras,</hi> we are sure, did not decline the office of restoring Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, imposed on him by the Pagan King <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But, that we may return unto our own, that is, unto Christian Powers (for that was aspersed on the by, to give others oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of better thoughts upon this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) we must advertise the Reader, that in all this Treatise, we enquire what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not what is at every time expedient. For, whether we reflect upon antient or later times, we shall see great variety in the manner of election: nor only through ages and Provinces, but through years and particular Cities. So much uncertainty there is in that, which the Law Divine hath left uncertain. And truly, where the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion <note place="margin">31. The best man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</note> is not of the right, but of the best manner of Election, 'tis marvellous how many things may probably be discoursed on every part. Give me <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and those of his time, there will be no fear of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar election. Give me the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, I would gladly ascribe the election unto Bishops. Give me such Emperours as <hi>Theodosius, Valentinian,</hi> and <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> there will be no danger in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Regall or Imperiall. But we are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:34728:125"/> into the lees of the Church, and after we have with circumspection viewed all things, we find nothing, but some incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity is annexed to it. Therefore nothing at all can be here prescribed, as perpetuall; <hi>That which is indefinite, must have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Rule.</hi> Yet if I were in this respect to give my advise, the manner of <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s times is not displeasing to me, with this caution, that a Pastor be not obtruded upon the people against their will, and also saving the right of the Highest Powers to rescind and make void Elections, if any <note place="margin">32. The Right of rescind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served stil to the H. Power.</note> errour be committed, pernicious to the Church or Common-wealth. Which right, not only the French Kings, but also the antient Roman Emperours very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently have used, as is most easie to be proved.</p>
                     <p>They do much erre, who confound this will and pleasure of the H. Powers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Election made is approv'd, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apporv'd with that consent, wherewith the Magistrate of every City, according to the Lawes or Canons, concur to the Election, in the next place to the Clergy, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with the People. For, here is a wide difference. The pleasure of the Highest Powers is over the Election; the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates consent is a part of the election.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:34728:125"/> That agrees to the Highest Powers, as such; this to the Magistrates, by Positive Law; nor properly as Magistrates, but as an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured part of the City. Therefore the Election by the Magistrates stayes within the bounds of their City; but Emperours and Kings exercise their right, not only in Cities which they dwell in, and whose Churches they frequent; but, if they see it needfull, through all places of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Again, the Magistrates may be overcome with suffrages, the Highest Power cannot. Certainly, although the election be permitted to others, that right of free approbation cannot safely be abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Him that rules in Chiefe. Also, <note place="margin">33. And of exaucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, if need be.</note> after Election made, the right of removing a certain person from the Ministry of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place, although it may be in others too, ought alwayes to remain in the Highest Power. So <hi>Solomon</hi> ejected <hi>Abiathar</hi> from being the Priest of God. So the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> were more then once deposed by the Imperial Power, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself confesseth. The proof whereof is easie. For if the Highest Power hath right to interdict any one the City or Province, hee must needs have a right also to interdict him, the Ministry of this City or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For this is included in that: and, in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:34728:126"/> whose Power the whole is, in his power the part cannot choose but be. Nor only may the Highest Power doe this by way of punishment, but by way of caution too: to wit, if any Pastor be drawn by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into matter of tumult, which perhaps may come to passe without his fault. For, unlesse the Highest Power could doe this, the Common-wealth were not sufficient to secure it selfe.</p>
                     <p>The last errour is of those, that think it <note place="margin">34. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though chosen by others.</note> belongs unto the same Person, to elect and to remove. For the Highest Power may interdict, not only publick acts, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, too, to which it electeth not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; namely, in negotiation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction: as above is said, when we spake of Jurisdiction, and is manifested by Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For, eight or more Roman Bishops, it is certain, have been dispos'd by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, sometimes with a Synod, sometimes without, whereof a good part were elected by the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is of much concernment for the <note place="margin">1. Things necessary to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguisht from not necessary.</note> keeping of peace in the Churches, to distinguish accurately, between the things commanded by Divine Law, and the things not commanded. For, although the right or manner of regiment somewhat differs, thence wil follow no divulsion of the Churches, as long as neither part ascribes to their own way, the authority of Divine precept. And this is the principall cause, why we have taken so much pains to shew, That manner of Election, which Kings and some pious Princes do at this time use, is not by Divine Law forbidden. Not, that we propose their examples to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by others: for, other kinds of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be either by themselves more profitable, or at least to the disposition of the people, and state of some Churches more fit; or else, if for no other cause, for the antient custome sake, to be preferr'd: but, that we may not, by a temerarious censure, alienate from us the Kings, and the Churches too, by whom that manner is observ'd. What we have done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:34728:127"/> Election, the same we must doe about the offices Ecclesiasticall, which some of the late Reformed Churches use, and some use not; That is, Wee must declare, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is either way defin'd concerning them, by Precept of Divine Law; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, it will easily appear, The diversity of government ought not to be any obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>rnall unity. Fully to understand the right of the Highest Powers, this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is very necessary; for, in things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by Divine Precept, a necessity of execution lyes upon the Highest Power; in other things there is left some liberty of choise. And, as we have said afore, The Ecclesiasticall Government for the most part is conformable to the Politicall, which was also observed by the King of Great <hi>Britain,</hi> a Prince of excellent wisedome.</p>
                     <p>Now, the principall Controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Protestants, is about the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall eminence, and about their office, who being not Pastors, that is, neither preach, nor administer the Sacraments, yet are Assessors, or assistants unto Pastors, <note place="margin">2. Of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Lay-El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> and by some are stiled Presbyters, or El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. Let us consider of both, so farre as our designe permits; for, these questions are so largely handled by others, that scarce any thing remains to be added.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:34728:127"/> Especially, the most learned <hi>Beza,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving undertaken the defence of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevian Discipline, hath, according to the fertilty and vigour of his wit, copiously expressed, what might be said both for those Assessors, and against the Bishops: And, on the other side, they that extoll the Anglican Church, <hi>Saravia</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> have disputed very smartly, as well for the Bishops, as against those Assessors. So that, whoever would have perfect intelligence of these matters, are to be remitted to their Books. For our parts, Our endeavour being to lessen, not to widen, the difference, we will contract into a few determinations, all that is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confessed on both sides, or may be so clearly prov'd that it cannot be gaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said by any, but the contumacious.</p>
                     <p>In the first place for Bishops; we take <note place="margin">3. The word Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, Here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>f Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors.</note> leave to use the word in that signification, wherein the Synods Universall and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picall, and all the Fathers have alwaies us'd it. In the Apostolicall times, it is certaine, though the Functions were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct, the names were not. For, the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Apostles is call'd <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> and <hi>Diaconacy;</hi> nor is any thing more usuall, than for the generi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call name, by some particular right, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:34728:128"/> to one of the species; as in <hi>adoption, cognation,</hi> and other words of the Law appears. And so, the name of <hi>Bishop,</hi> when in the nature of the word it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies any <hi>Inspector, Oversoer,</hi> and <hi>Praepositus,</hi> or (as <hi>Jerom</hi> translates it) <hi>supra-at endent</hi> (for the Septuagint also have rendred the Hebrew word, which is given to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, by the name of <hi>Bishop;</hi> and among the <hi>Athenians</hi> the forreigne Praetor; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans the municipall Aediles were called by this name; and <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, Himself was made Bishop of the Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panian coast:) this name by the Apostles, and Apostolicall men, according to the use of the Hellenists, was given to any Pastors of the Church. Neverthelesse; by a certaine proper and peculiar right; it might be assignd to them, who, as with the rest they were Overseers of all the Flock, so above the rest were constituted Inspectors of the Pastors also. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they abuse their own time and other mens, who having undertaken to discusse the question, take much pains to prove the name of Bishop common to all the Pastors: when as the word is of a larger signification much. They also doe but beat the aire, who with great endeavour prove, that unto all Pastors whatsoever
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:34728:128"/> certain things were common, namely, the right to Preach, to exhibite the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the like. For, the question is not of these things wherein they do agree, but of that eminence whereby they are distinguished. And, that is yet somewhat more absurd, that some, to prove Bishops differ nothing from meere Presbyters, bring in the Fathers for their witnesses, <hi>That Bishops are all of equall merit:</hi> as if you did say, <hi>That all the Roman Senators were equall to the Consuls,</hi> because the dignity of both the Consuls was equall. But he is angry with himself, or with his Reader, who refutes such things.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Episcopacy then, that is, <note place="margin">4 Bishops not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods word.</note> the eminence of one Pastor among the rest, this is our first Assertion, <hi>That it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to no Law Divine.</hi> If any one be of a contrary opinion, that is, if any one condemne all the antient Church of folly, or even of impiety; without question, it lyes upon him to prove it: and for proofe I see nothing alleg'd but this: <hi>Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your</hi>
                        <note place="margin">

                        <hi>Minister: and whosoever of you will bee chief, shall be the servant of all.</hi> But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, all eminence or Primacy of Pastors among Pastors is not here interdicted: but all Pastors are admonisht, that they
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:34728:129"/> may know, that a Ministry is enjoyn'd them, not an Empire given. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent words are, <hi>They that rule over the Gentiles exercise Lordship over them; and their Great ones exercise Authority upon them; But so shall it not bee among you.</hi> From this place we may much rather ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue for Eminence and Primacy, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it. For that which is in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke, Whosoever will be great,</hi> and <hi>the chief,</hi> is in <hi>Luke, He that is greatest among</hi>

                        <hi>you:</hi> He that is the President, or leader. Moreover, Christ exhorts them by his own example: <hi>The son of man came not to bee ministred unto, but to minister.</hi> Wherefore, the precept of Ministring doth not hinder, but one may be greater than they to whom he Ministreth. <hi>Ye call me,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Lord and Master: and ye say well; for so I am. Therefore if I your</hi>

                        <hi>Lord and Master have washed your feet, ye ought also to wash one anothers feet.</hi> And how could Christ disapprove the dispari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Ecclesiasticall Offices, when him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self had appointed LXX.

                        <hi>given some Apostles, and some Prophets,</hi>
                        <pb n="247" facs="tcp:34728:129"/>
                        <hi>some Evangelists, some Pastors and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors:</hi> not only distinct in Functions, but by certaine degrees also. <hi>For God hath given in the Church, first Apostles, in the second place Prophets, in the third Doctors.</hi> The very Deaconry, by the Apostles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, is sufficient to prove, that Christ had not commanded an equality of Church-men. Therefore, we set down this first, as a thing of undoubted verity; Wherein we have <hi>Zanchius, Chemnitius, Hemingius, Calvin, Melanchthon, Bucer,</hi> all consenting with us; yea, and <hi>Beza</hi> too, so far as to say, <hi>That some one chosen by the judgement of the other Presbyters, should be and remaine President of the Presbytery, cannot, nor ought not to be reprehended.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we determine, <hi>That the Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy</hi>
                        <note place="margin">5. Bishops alwaies in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church.</note>
                        <hi>we speak of, hath been received by the Universall Church.</hi> This appears out of the Universall Councils; whose Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, even now, among pious men is very Sacred. It appears also, by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Synods either Nationall or Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall; whereof there is hardly one to be found, but it carries in the forehead ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest signs of Episcopall eminence. All the Fathers, none excepted, testify the same. Among whom, the least friend to Episcopacy is <hi>Jerom,</hi> being himself
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:34728:130"/> not a Bishop, but a Presbyter. His testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony therefore alone sufficeth: <hi>It was decreed all the world over, that one chosen from among the Presbyters should bee set over the rest, to whom all the care of the Church should pertaine.</hi> Yea, so universall was this Custome, that it was observed even among the Hereticks, which went out of the Catholick Church; <hi>All these things,</hi> saith the Author of the Homilies upon <hi>Matthew, which are proper to Christ in verity, have Hereticks also in their Schism, Churches, Scriptures, Bishops, and other orders of the Clergy, Baptisme, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, and all things else.</hi> Certainly, this errour of <hi>Aerius</hi> was condemned of all the Church, that he said, <hi>A Presbyter ought to be discerned from a Bishop by no difference. Jerom</hi> himself, to him who had written, <hi>There is no difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter,</hi> answers, <hi>'Tis spoken as ignorantly, as one would wish: you have, as the Proverbe is, made shipwrack in the Haven.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Zanchius</hi> also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the consent of the whole Church in this point.</p>

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34728:134"/> were stil'd Apostles. And truly, there remain in <hi>Cyprian</hi> and other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours, not a few obscure prints of this lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; Yea, <hi>Paul</hi> himself, when he saith, Hee was nothing lesse than the <hi>chiefe of the Apostles,</hi> seems to intimate, there were some other <hi>Apostles of lesser mark.</hi> That the name of <hi>Angel</hi> was antiently given to him, who afterward began to be called Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> evinceth.

It is certain, there were degrees of Priests among the Heathens; that the Custom was not new to the Grecians, and such as sprang from Greece, we learn by the most antient discipline of the <hi>Druids. One,</hi> saith <hi>Caesar, is President to the</hi> Druids, <hi>who hath amongst them the chief Authority.</hi> And how antient the Eminence of Mother Cities, in matters of
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:34728:134"/> Religion, is, we learn out of <hi>Thucydides,</hi> where he speaks of the <hi>Corcyreans,</hi> a Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> upon which pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, the old Scholiast notes, <hi>It was the Custome to receive High Priests from the Metropolis. Strabo</hi> names <hi>one Priest</hi> of the <hi>Catti,</hi> who was, we make no doubt, the highest; and among the <hi>Burgundians</hi> the <hi>greatest Priest</hi> is mention'd by <hi>Marcellinus.</hi> This custome, God himself approved by the legall Constitution of the Judaical Republick; when hee set up One, with highest Authority, over all the Priests. Who, although in some acts hee was a Type of Christ, yet the whole Institution of this Pontificate, is not to be referr'd to this end alone. This eminence of one Priest, served for Order also, as well as the Regall Power, which did also, in its way, adumbrate Christ. Although then, this example might suffice; yet to me, the Constitution of the Christian Church, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not so much expressed, according to the pattern of the Temple at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> as of the Synagogues. For the Synagogues were, in many places, without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Power; as neither the Church of Christ hath any by it self. Adde hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, that wheresoever the Apostles came, they found Synagogues well enough orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:34728:135"/> even from the times if the Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an dispersion: which, if they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Faith of Christ, (as to them the Gospel was Preached before others) there was no cause, why they should depart from that Government, that the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of many ages did commend: nor was it any burden to the Gentiles, in such a matter, to accommodate themselves to the Jewish institutions. Now in every Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, it is certaine, there was one, who by the Greekish Jews was call'd the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of the Synagogue:</hi> which name occurs frequently, both in the Gospell and the <hi>Acts;</hi> and every where the Prince of the <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Lu.</hi> 8. 41.</note> Synagogue is designed by it. Only, one place is excepted; where, the word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 15.</note> taken in a larger sense, in one Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue are named more Rulers, that is, both he, who (as the Hebrew Masters teach us) was the <hi>Prince,</hi> who answers to our Bishop; and then the Pastors, which Office and name remains in the Christian Church; and the Elemosynaries, which are like unto our Deacons. Wherefore in that one place the Pastors joyned to the chiefe of the Synagogue are call'd <hi>the Rulers.</hi> So, in the new Testament of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the High Priest, with those next unto him, are called the <hi>chief Priests,</hi> and in

                        <hi>Rulers of the Synagogues</hi> had others over them, which were called <hi>Primates;</hi> in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">L. ult. Cod.

                     <p>Our fifth Assertion is, Episcopacy hath been the spring-head, whence many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities <note place="margin">12. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of great use to the Church.</note> have flowed into the Church. The History of all times proclaims it: but I will againe use him for my witnesse, who in all Antiquity was the least friend of Bishops, that is, <hi>Jerom: In the whole world,</hi> saith he, <hi>it was decreed, that for the taking away of Schisms and divisions, one being elected from among the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, should be set above the rest.</hi> In another place. <hi>The Churches safety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in the dignity of the chiefest Priest, that is, the Bishop: to whom if there be not given a Superiour power over all the rest, there will be made so many Schisms in the Church, as there be Priests.</hi> Nor is it any thing else, which <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcate: <hi>Whence have Schisms and Heresies arisen, and doe still arise in the Church, but while the Bishop which is one, and the Governour of the Church, by the proud presumption of some men is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi> And elsewhere: <hi>Heresies have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                        <pb n="260" facs="tcp:34728:136"/>
                        <hi>Rise, and Schisms no other beginning, but hence, that obedience is not given to Gods Priest; nor is one Priest and Judge for the time, in the steed of Christ elected.</hi> Not only single Assemblies, by the presidence of one, were guarded against Schisms, but as the same <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, <hi>The Universall Church was coupled together by the chaine of Priests, linked to one another and united.</hi> For, the whole Christian world was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in concord, by commerce of those Letters, which were call'd <hi>formatae.</hi> And so much for Episcopall eminence.</p>
                     <p>To proceed: On behalf of the equality of Pastors, we have these things to say, <note place="margin">13. Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops are not by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</note> not repugnant to those afore. First, <hi>The Episcopall eminence is not of Divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept.</hi> This is prov'd enough, because the contrary is not prov'd. For Christ is no where read to have commanded it. Indeed, he approv'd it in the Apocalyps: but it follows not, Because he did approve it, Therefore he did command it. Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is of Apostolicall institution, because it appears, in some Churches Bishops were ordained or approved by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles: but the Apostles never comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that such Bishops should be in every Church. By which distinction, we sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Jeroms</hi> case from the case of <hi>Aerius.</hi>
                        <pb n="261" facs="tcp:34728:136"/>
                        <hi>Jerom</hi> saith, <hi>The Bishops became greater than the Presbyters, by custome rather than by the Lords dispose:</hi> As also <hi>Austin, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy is greater than Presbytery, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the titles of honour, which the Church hath used.</hi> When the Fathers speak of Custome, they exclude not Apostolicall institution; yea, as <hi>Austin</hi> saith, <hi>What is</hi>

That the people should with a clear voice say <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of prayers, That the Preacher should be uncover'd, was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution in the Apostolicall Church: Which in many places now, we see, is not observed. Moreover, the Apostles so appointed Bishops, that they left cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches without Bishops: as <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> acknowledges, <hi>There was need of Presbyters and Deacons; for by these two the Ecclesiasticall Offices may be compleat; but where none was found worthy of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopacy, the place remain'd without a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop;</hi>

                        <hi>but, where was need; and they were worthy of the Episcopacy, Bishops were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained.</hi> Those Churches therefore, as <hi>Jerom</hi> speaks, <hi>were govern'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Counsell of the Presbyters.</hi>

                        <hi>Bishop should be over every City.</hi> Of the Apostles time, we suppose it is already prov'd. And afterward, more Bishops than one were in the same City, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Jews, who had as many chief Rulers as they had Synagogues; but in one City often times were many Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, or (as <hi>Philo</hi> cals them) <hi>Proseuchae,</hi> places of prayer. So, at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> was one Synagogue of <hi>Libertines,</hi> another of <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 6. 9. 18. 8. 17.</note> the <hi>Cyrenians,</hi> a third of the <hi>Alexandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi> And at <hi>Corinth,</hi> about the same time, were named two chief Rulers of Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, <hi>Crispus</hi> and <hi>Sosthenes. Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> declares, it was instituted first at <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> that in the whole City should be but one Bishop. At last in the VIII. Nicene Canon, we see it was defin'd, <hi>That there should not be two Bishops in any City:</hi> yet so, that withall it appears, the Canon was sometimes dispenc'd with. For, the Canon permits, that Bishops returning from the Sect of the <hi>Cathari,</hi> to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:34728:137"/> Church, should retein Episcopall honour, next to the Catholick Bishop. So, the <hi>Ephesin</hi> Synod, after the Election of <hi>Theodorus,</hi> grants that honour to <hi>Eusta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> as appears by an Epistle to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Pamphilia:</hi> and, in the conference before <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> the Catholicks offer the same unto the Donatists, if they would returne unto Communion; <hi>Every one of us, receiving an associate of his honour, may sit with greater eminence, the peregrine Bishops sitting by as a Colleuge. Valerius</hi> also, in the Church of <hi>Hippo,</hi> assumed <hi>Austin</hi> to himselfe. Which, although <hi>Austin</hi> saith 'twas done through ignorance of the Canons, appears yet to have been a thing not unheard of afore, much lesse believ'd repugnant to the Law Divine. Moreover, the Episcopall Chairs, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cities, were often void, not for some months only, but many years together; all which time, <hi>The Churches,</hi> that I may againe speak with <hi>Jerom, were govern'd by the Common Counsell of the Presbyters:</hi> or, as <hi>Ignatius</hi> saith, <hi>The Presbyters fed</hi>

Furthermore, all the antients doe confesse, there is no act, except Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, so proper to the Bishop, but it may be exercis'd by the Presbyter. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> and <hi>Jerom</hi> are very clear in this point. And, although in the judgement of these <note place="margin">15. In whom is the right o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Synod of <hi>Carthage: When a Presbyter is ordain'd, the Bishop blessing him, and holding his hand upon his head, let all the Presbyters also, that are present, hold their hands upon his head, by the Bishops hand.</hi> For the confirmation hereof, I dare not bring that of <hi>Paul,</hi> concerning the <hi>laying on of hands of the Presbytery,</hi> because I perceive, <hi>Jerom, Ambrose,</hi> and other antient, and, the Prince of all recent writers, <hi>Calvin,</hi> interpret Presbytery in that place, not the <hi>consistory,</hi> but the <hi>Office</hi> to which <hi>Timothy</hi> was promoted. And truly, whosoever is versed in the Councils, and the writings of the Fathers, cannot be ignorant, <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi>
                        <pb n="265" facs="tcp:34728:138"/> as <hi>Episcopacy</hi> and <hi>Diaconacy,</hi> to bee names of Offices. And, seeing it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that <hi>Paul</hi> laid hands on <hi>Timothy,</hi> it seemeth neither necessary nor convenient, to joyn fellows with him for an Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall act, and Collation of miraculous gifts. In the meane time, I doe not see, how this can be refelled, (even among the Schoolmen, <hi>Antisiodorensis</hi> long since granted it:) where Bishops are not, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination may be rightly made by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters. For, the things that are observed for order sake, admit exceptions. So, in the antient Councill of <hi>Carthage,</hi> it is permitted Presbyters in case of necessity, <hi>to reconcile penitents:</hi> and in another place, <hi>to lay hands on the Baptized.</hi> Moreover, as we have said above, it is doubtfull, whether Presbyters, that neither have Presbyters under them, nor a Bishop o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, are neerer to Bishops or more Presbyters. For, of <hi>Timothy</hi> also, <hi>Ambrose</hi> argues thus, <hi>He that had not an other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him was a Bishop.</hi> And, we know, (to take an instance in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth) many things are lawfull for a Senate having not a King, which to a Senate under a Kings Power, are unlawfull. For, a Senate without a King is as it were a King.</p>

                     <p> This is our third Assertion: <hi>The causes</hi>
                        <note place="margin">16. For what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops were laid by in some Churches.</note>
                        <hi>were not light, why, in this age, in some places, at least for some time, Episcopacy was omitted.</hi> That the causes are tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, <hi>Beza</hi> himself seems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when he saith, He is not the man, to think the old order were not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stor'd, <hi>if the ruines of the Church were once repair'd.</hi> Of these causes, the first might be the penury of men, sufficient for so grave an Office; for, if that were a cause just enough, while the Church was yong, to omit, in many places, the Episcopall eminence, as we heard <hi>Epiphanius</hi> say; why then, at the Churches Rise out of the thickest darknesse, might not the same cause take place, especially in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where was found not one of the old Bishops, that would yield up himself to truth, and open his eyes to see the light held forth. Another cause of this omis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, might be the long and inveterate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of the Episcopall Office. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> of old complains, some Episcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his time had exceeded the bounds of Sacerdotall purity, and were corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Domination. <hi>Hierax</hi> complains in <hi>Pelusiot,</hi> the Dignity of lenity and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse was advanced into Tyranny. <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zianzene</hi> complains of the ambition of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:34728:139"/> Bishops, and for that reason wisheth, if not Episcopacy, yet at least that perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all right of Cities in retaining Episcopall dignity, were changed: <hi>Would to God, there were neither Presidency nor preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of place, nor tyrannicall power; that we might all receive our estimate by vertue alone.</hi> The Fathers of the <hi>Ephesin</hi> Synod long since professe themselves afraid, <hi>lest that, under the colours of the Sacred Function, should commence the pride of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power.</hi> And it is easy to find the like say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the <hi>African</hi> Councils. But verily, never did Ecclesiastical ambition, from the Apostles age unto those times, advance to such a hight, as it hath done since those times, to the memory of our Fathers. So that now, without cutting off the part wherein the cause lyeth, the disease seems almost impossible to be cur'd. It is true, good things are not to be condemn'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some men abuse them: yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse being turn'd into a custome, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission of the things themselves is not infrequent. The Mosaicall Serpent might have remained without Superstition, if the thing it self were considered: but <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah</hi> respecting the grown vice of the people, that he might take away the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, took away the Serpent. I am
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:34728:140"/> loth to say, that the name and eminence Episcopall, by their fault, to whom it had fallen, had lost all its reverence, and was come into the <hi>odium</hi> of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; to whom, even when they are in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, somewhat sometimes is to be yiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. The Romans, being evill intreated by the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> took an oath, they would no more endure a King at <hi>Rome.</hi> A third cause may be added, that in those most infestious times, the Preachers of the truth, being hated for the truths sake, were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to acquit themselves, not only from the crime of ambition, but from all suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too; which when by taking away the Episcopall dignity they sollicitously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd, for all this, they escaped not the calumny of their adversaries. What reproaches should they not have heard, had the change of Doctrine been joyned with the acquisition of preferment? I will adde one cause more, why, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Repurgation, Episcopacy was not very necessary. God had raised up excellent men, of great wit, of great lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of great esteeme, both among their own, and the neighbouring people: few indeed in number, but such as were able to beare the weight of many businesses: Their high reputation amongst all, easily
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:34728:140"/> supplyed the defect of Episcopacy. But, (if we will with <hi>Zanchy</hi> confesse the plaine truth,) none were indeed more truely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops than they, whose Authority (although this was not their design) prevailed even to the overthrow of Bishops. Nor is that here to be omitted, which we have said already more than once, The Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Government, for the most part, receives some impression from the Civill. In the Roman Empire, the Bishops were correspondent to the Dukes, the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans to the Presidents, the Patriarchs or Primats to the Vicars or Deputies of the Emperour. What marvell is it then, if people more accustomed to an Optima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than Monarchy, would have the Church affairs committed rather to the Clergy, than the Bishop? And these are the causes, wherefore I think the Churches may be excus'd, which have no Bishops: whilst yet they abstaine from a disapprobation of the most Sacred order, and withall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what <hi>Beza</hi> judged in no wise to be omitted: <hi>That was Essentiall,</hi> saith he, <note place="margin">

                        <hi>which by the perpetuall ordainance of God, hath been, is, and shall be necessary; that in the Presbytery some one, both in place and dignity the first, oversee and governe the action, by that right which God hath given him.</hi>

                     <pb n="270" facs="tcp:34728:141"/>
                     <p> Let us come unto those <hi>Assessors,</hi> whom in many places we see joyned to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors out of the people, by an annuall or bienniall Office. They call them Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, when yet they neither Preach the Gospell to the people, nor exhibite the Sacraments. Concerning them, this is our judgement.</p>
                     <p>First we say, <hi>Those temporary Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
                        <note place="margin">17. Lay-Elders, none in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall time.</note>
                        <hi>are strangers to the Apostolicall and antient Church:</hi> nor have I seen any, that would affirme, much lesse could prove, that they were known of old. <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> prescribing against Hereticks, among other things declares, how much their temerarious, inconstant, light Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons differ from the Rule of the antient Church: <hi>This day,</hi> saith he, <hi>the man is a Presbyter, who to morrow is a laick:</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be more clearly said, to make it appeare, that <hi>temporary Presbyters</hi> were in those times unkown to the Catholick Church. It is not, say some, materiall to the nature of the Office, whether it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken for a time, or for ever. If this be so, I may wonder, that Pastors also, employed in the word and Sacraments, are not made Annuall somewhere. But if this be absurd, whence I pray, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as the gifts of God are without
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:34728:141"/> repentance, so the Divine Offices were instituted by him for the perpetuall uses of the Church? <hi>He that hath put his hand to the Plow, and looketh back, is not fit for the kingdome of God:</hi> that is, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of the Church. Wherefore, this very change of Assessors, is no light ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that this is an invention of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane prudence, no institution of Law Divine.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>All the antient Church, by the</hi>

                        <hi>name of Presbyters, understood no other men, but Pastors employed in the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</hi> I speak not of the word <hi>old men,</hi> or <hi>Seniors</hi> and <hi>Elders:</hi> whereby, 'tis certaine, sometimes age, sometimes Magistracy is meant: but, of the Greek word, which in the Latine tongue doth alwaies signify the Pastorall dignity and Office: and so it doth also in the Greek Authours, wheresoever the word <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> notes any thing else but age or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy. We are not yet come to that place of <hi>Paul,</hi> which belongs rather to the question of Divine Right: and of the Elders of the old Testament, there will be place to speak hereafter. Of so great a number of Fathers, of so many volumes of books, after so long canvasing of this controversie, not so much as one place
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:34728:142"/> hath been alleged, wherein the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall dignity is ascribed to any other than Pastors; When yet, if there had been two sorts of Presbyters, not often, but a hundred, yea a thousand times mention of them ought to have been made especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Canons, which describe unto us the whole Government of the Church; at least the manner of electing those <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, non-Pastors,</hi> would somewhere shew it self. And although the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, or he that is on the Negative, is not to make proofe; yet were it easy to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce infinite places of the Fathers, which attribute to all Presbyters the right of feeding the flock, of Baptising, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting the Lords body; and, so far, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall all the Presbyters to Bishops, and call them the Apostles Successors: which also declare, the Presbyters punishment was, to be remov'd from the Presbytery, or for a time to be admitted only to the Communion of the Laicks: which far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shew, that maintenance was given to every one, and a much severer Discipline prescrib'd for them than others. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over Laws are extant too, of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Privileges, and immunity from Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill Courts and burdens; and many other things there are, which will not suffer us
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:34728:142"/> to acknowledge any Presbyters, but Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors only.</p>
                     <p>Some allege a History of the <hi>peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary</hi>

But who ever heard of any Penitentiary, that was not a Pastor? or, when did the antients ever believe, that the use of the Keys might be separated from the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments?

Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors may be call'd Priests.</note> is ignorant, that the Fathers by <hi>Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> or Priests, doe meane Pastors, to whom the Word and Sacraments are
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:34728:143"/> entrusted: indeed, beside the use of the new Testament, but not without Authority of Scripture; for in <hi>Esay</hi> God foretelling the calling of the Gentiles by the Gospell, saith, <hi>And I will also take of them</hi> (the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Es.</hi> 66. 21.</note> Gentiles) <hi>for Priests, and for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits.</hi> Wherefore, the exercise of the Keys, and the Right to absolve penitents, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the judgement of all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, agree to Priests alone, that is, to Presbyters, the Depositaries of the Word and Sacraments. Wherefore also, these Presbyters, who specially attended to the absolving of Penitents, are to be thought no other than Priests, whom the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament stileth Pastors.</p>
                     <p>Now, as the word <hi>Presbyter,</hi> when it signifies a Function Ecclesiasticall, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in the Fathers applyed to other than Pastors; so neither is the Latine word <hi>Seniors.

                        </note> he, <hi>with great Gravity, as in the presence of God; and it is a very great prejudgement of the future judgement, if any one hath so offended, as to be excluded from Common Prayer, and the Assembly, and all holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. The most approved Seniors are the Presidents, having obtained the honour by testimony, not by price; for no Divine thing</hi>
                        <pb n="275" facs="tcp:34728:143"/>
                        <hi>is set to sale.</hi> That in those times Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries consisted only of Pastors, <hi>Calvin</hi> himself confesseth; wherefore, <hi>Tertullian</hi> putting the Greek word into Latine, cals them <hi>Seniors,</hi> who had the power of the Keys. For in Greek they are call'd <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters:</hi> which word, in its primary sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, expressing age, was after trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Civill Dignities, and last of all to Ecclesiasticall. Let all the Acts of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, that ever were, bee read quite thorough, there will be found no <hi>Seniors,</hi> that were not Pastors. Moreover the word <hi>major natu,</hi> or Elder, which seemeth proper to age, began to be applyed to Pastors, in imitation of the Greek word. <hi>Firmilian</hi> Bishop of <hi>Cesarea: The Majors are the Presidents (in the Church) who have also the power to Baptise, and to impose hands, and to ordaine:</hi> He hath given suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient caution, to understand no other then the Pastors. So then, the words, <hi>Presbyter, Senior, Major,</hi> have a threefold signification, noting First age, Secondly Magistracy, Thirdly Priesthood. Nor only was the name of <hi>Seniors</hi> common to Magistrats and Pastors, but the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Presbyters, the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> which <hi>Ignatius</hi> calls the <hi>Sacred System, Jerom</hi> hath translated <hi>Senate: The Church hath</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Farther, we must observe, by the word Seniors, Ecclesiasticall writers doe often understand not dignity, but age.

                     <p>But, most worthy of our consideration is that place of an uncertaine Authour, commonly reputed <hi>Ambrose,</hi> out of his Commentaries on <hi>Pauls</hi> Epistles. The
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:34728:145"/> words are these: <hi>Old age indeed is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable among all Nations? Whence it is, that both the Synagogue, and afterward the Church had Seniors, without whose advice nothing passed in the Church.

Whether the Magistrates, who were called Seniors sure enough, that the Synagogue may be a Bench of Judges, as in <hi>Matthew, They shall scourge you in their Synagogues?</hi> I <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cap.</hi> 10. 17.</note> think not although many things (as we shall shew anone) which belonged to the Jewish Magistrates, are wont by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine similitude, to bee applyed to the Christian Presbyters. Hear the same Author elsewhere declaring: <hi>It was a Tradition of the Synagogue, that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors (in dignity) disputed sitting in their Chairs, the next on Benches, the last in the pavement upon mats.</hi> I suspect the word (in dignity) stole out of the margin into the text. For <hi>Philo</hi> describes the same custome thus, <hi>They that come to be Priests take their places in order according to their age, the younger beneath the elder.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:34728:146"/> the Seniors in age sate first. And, questionlesse, some such order of sitting was observed in the antient Church; which <hi>James</hi> would not have neglected, when he reprehends them, that give the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the higher seats to rich men only, the poor being thrust down below, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to stand. It follows in <hi>Philo, One of the most skilfull, passing over the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult places (of the Holy Bible) makes an exposition of them.</hi> 'Tis to be noted, in the Synagogues of the Jews, to every one exercised in Holy Writ, (and all were so, <note place="margin">24. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to interpret Scripture in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue.</note> except mechanicks, as also among us) it was permitted to interpret Scripture. By this common liberty, Christ taught in the Synagoues, and after him the Apostles. Memorable are the places, <hi>Luke</hi> iv. and <hi>Acts</hi> xiii. There the book is reached forth to Christ: here <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> though unknown, are asked to speak unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>If they have any word of exhortation.</hi> If no stranger, or none of the people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd himself, then the chosen men of the Seniors (who were nam'd the Fathers of the Synagogues, the Majors, and by an excellency the Seniors) interpreted the Law. And these being not well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it was the Rulers Office. Somewhat correspondent to this, we find in the first
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:34728:146"/> Christian Church. For, they that have <note place="margin">25. And in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church: with the difference</note> the gift of prophecy are permitted by the Apostle to speak unto the people at the Assembly, by two or three, and the rest to judge. That miraculous gift ceasing, it was hardly lawfull for any one, except the Pastors, to teach among the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Indeed, we read of <hi>Origen</hi> and a few more, not Presbyters, who taught in the Church: but that was seldome, and not without peculiar licence of the Bishops. For the Bishop of <hi>Caesarea</hi> being reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for permitting <hi>Origen</hi> to teach, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged three examples of the like conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, adding, it was credible, though not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, the same was done in other places. Here now we see some difference between the Interpreters of the Law in the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, and the Interpreters of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell in the Church. In the Synagogue, they taught, as many as <hi>had any word of exhortation:</hi> in the Church, all that <hi>were approved and had obtained the honour of a Testimoniall,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks, that is, they that were <hi>ordained.</hi> The Judges of the Highest Synedry were wont to be <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi> by imposition of hands: but of the expounders of the Law, the same doth not appeare. A reason of the foresaid diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, not only because the Preaching
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:34728:147"/> of the Gospel is of more moment, than the expounding of the Law; but also, because in the Christian Church the Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the word are withall dispensers of the mysteries. Whereas, the Masters of the Synagogue administred no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For all the Sacrifices were offer'd in the Temple only, except the Passeover; which yet was not celebrated in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, but in every house, the Master of the Family being chief. Nor was it any where commanded, that Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion should be given in the Synagogues, or by any speciall Ministers. It may then be doubted, what <hi>Seniors</hi> of the Church, <hi>Pseudambrose</hi> understands: those, that answer to the <hi>most skilfull</hi> of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who also are scarce any other but aged men, (in which respect the chief of the Monks are called <hi>Seniors</hi> in <hi>Justini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an:)</hi> or those, that answer to the <hi>Elders</hi>

                        <hi>in age,</hi> in <hi>Philo?</hi> If the former, then <hi>Pseud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambrose</hi> saith the very same with <hi>Jerom.</hi> The one, <hi>Without the Counsell of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors nothing in the Church was done:</hi> the other, <hi>The Churches were govern'd by the Common Counsell of the Presbyters:</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of those Presbyters, which, he saith, at first were called Bishops, and out of whom afterward the Bishops were elected.
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:34728:147"/> But if the later please you more, (and truly his speech mention'd his age, not Office:) the meaning will be this, which we have exprest a little afore; That, insteed of all the people, the Elder men were wont to be consulted with, in the more weighty affairs: that is, in ordaining the Cleriks, in absolving the lapsed, and such like. And indeed, it is more credible, this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome was long since obsolete and disus'd, to consult with the people or the chief of the people, than that the Bishops did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all things without consulting with the Clergy. Yet this also by little and little came to passe and prevailed against the antient custome. These things therefore being understood, no man will hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth doubt, but in all Ecclesiasticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the word <hi>Presbyters</hi> or <hi>Seniors</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains either to the aged in the Church, or to the Magistrates, who also are a part of the Church, or to the Pastors. And this ought to prevaile with us, that we take not, unadvisedly and without forcible arguments, the places of Holy Scripture speaking of Presbyters, in any other sense, than they have been taken by them, who being nearer to the Apostles times had more perfect intelligence of that antient Title.</p>
                     <pb n="284" facs="tcp:34728:148"/>
                     <p> But now let us proceed to the Oracles of Holy Scripture▪ and let this be our third Assertion: <hi>Those choice Assessors of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, of whom we dispute, are not by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi>
                        <note place="margin">26. Lay-Elders, or Assessors, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by God.</note>
                        <hi>precept.</hi> Whosoever affirms the contrary must condemne the Church of so many ages, for contempt of Gods Law: from which temerity, we think it becomes us to abstaine. Nor indeed is there any weight in their arguments, who affirme that which wee deny, and upon whom therefore lyes the necessity of proving. Sufficient answers have been returned heretofore by very learned men: yet lest any defect be in our Treatise, it will be worth our pains, to repeat what hath been well said, and to adde somewhat that may bring light unto the question.</p>
                     <p>In the front, we have that which Christ <note place="margin">27. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 17. Explai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference 'twixt the Synedry and the Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</note> commandeth, <hi>Tell it to the Church,</hi> &amp;c. In which place, some are of opinion, Christ hath given the Church direction, to institute a certaine Synedry to judge of things Ecclesiasticall, consisting both of Ministers and other persons; for such they will needs have Ecclesiasticall Synedrys to have been. As for the words of Christ, the antient and recent expositors have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd us sundry explications of them. To repeat them all were tedious. To me, the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:34728:148"/> most simple and plaine Interpretation, and which comprehends almost all the rest seemeth to be this: The man, that hath offended us, is not easily to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for one deplored and incurable. There are severall degrees of admonition to be observ'd, first alone, that he may, if it be possible, repent without a witnesse of his fault; if that avails not, a friend is to be taken with you; one, a second, and a third, if perhaps he will yield to their Authority. And hitherto Christ hath said nothing, which is not almost in the same words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd in the writings of the Jews. For this is extant in the book <hi>Musar. If,</hi> say they, <hi>hee will neither then bee reconciled,</hi> (friends being used, two or three,) <hi>let him depart, and leave him to himself; for such a one is implacable, and is call'd a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> But the same book in another place addes one degree more; for thus it saith, <hi>If neither by this means he shall prevaile any thing</hi> (friends being used) <hi>then he ought to make him ashamed in the presence of many.</hi> Which Christ not disapproving, according to his exceeding lenity, which he would have us to imitate, would have us try all things first, before we give up the man for lost; for that is the sense of, <hi>Let him be unto thee as a Heathen and as a</hi>
                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:34728:149"/>
                        <hi>Publican:</hi> that is, an incorrigible sinner. So, in the Gospel are often joyn'd, <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 19. <hi>Mar.</hi> 11. 15.</note>
                        <hi>and sinners;</hi> and the Gentiles are call'd <hi>sinners,</hi> as when Christ saith, hee should be deliver'd into the hands of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi> Wherefore the meaning of Christ is, that before we relinquish all hope, after a few witnesses, any company of pious men ought to be adhibited, to the end the scandalous person may be reclaim'd, by the number and consent of grave men, <hi>by the punishment or censure of many,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks. For in <hi>Musar</hi> and in <hi>Paul the many,</hi> and in the words of Christ <hi>the Church,</hi> are the very same. Certainly, that a Company not great, is comprehended in the name of <hi>Church,</hi> both the LXX. teach us, and <hi>Paul</hi> too, who hath entitled, by the name of Church, one family of pious people. Here it sufficeth, that it be understood, this place in <hi>Matthew</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to their purpose; for a company both of Pastors, and of non-Pastors, may be without the Assessors, of whom now the question is.</p>
                     <p>What they adde concerning the Jewish Senates, after long consideration, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not grant. The <hi>Synagogues</hi> of the Jews, their <hi>Proseuchae,</hi> and <hi>Phrontisteries,</hi> as <hi>Philo</hi> cals them, were far different from
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:34728:149"/> their Courts of judgement. In their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuchae</hi> were the Scriptures read and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, all were instructed (to speak againe with <hi>Philo) to the love of God, to the love of vertue, to the love of men:</hi> whereto answer those three words of <hi>Paul, Godly, soberly, justly.</hi> Here are no judgments exercised upon any. That was done in the Courts of judgement; where the Judges had cognizance of Sacred matters as well as of Profane; the same Judges, by the same Law; for in the Hebrew people these were never disjoyn'd. These Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were partly in the severall Cities, partly in the Head City. Those were the lesser Synedryes, to the Hellenists; this the Great one, and by an excellency <hi>the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedry.</hi> Whence the Hebrews following the Hellenists derived <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> None of these Courts, because they had all of them coactive power, could be retained in the Apostolicall Church; because, it is certaine, neither the Apostles, nor the Church had any coactive power granted to them.</p>
                     <p>I come unto the name of <hi>Presbyters,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">28. Lay-Elders not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> which many think, in the new Testament was given to the Assessors of Pastors; which is not clear to me. In the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I find three significations of this
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:34728:150"/> word: one which pertains to age, as when the <hi>Presbyters</hi> or Elders are oppos'd to <note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1</note> the younger; another, which belongs to Power and Empire, as when there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that sate in the great Syne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry or in the lesse; a third, which agrees to the Preachers of the Gospell; a fourth I doe not find. A question may be made, <note place="margin">29. Why Pastors were call'd El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles.</note> why the Apostles call'd the Pastors, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by them, by the name of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Was it, because scarce any other but old men were called to that Office? or, because in the Synagogue also the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, by an excellency, had that appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? or, (which I like as well) by a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude taken from the Jewish Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates? For, Christ himself, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his Church, that he might shew himself a King, and withall by degrees might abolish the hope of an earthly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, composed his Church, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of all externall power, to a certaine Image of the Judaicall Kingdome, and so erected the minds of his Disciples to the hope of a Kingdome Celestiall. There <note place="margin">30. The Church of Christ compared with the Judaicall Kingdom.</note> was one King among the Hebrew people: He also acknowledgeth himself to bee a <hi>King.</hi> In that Kingdome were twelve Princes of their Tribes: Christ constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to himself so many <hi>Apostles;</hi> and, that
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:34728:150"/> it might not be doubted, whether he had respect, promiseth to them twelve thrones, whereon they should judge the twelve tribes of <hi>Israel.</hi> In the Kingdome, were LXX Senators of the Great Synedry: so many <hi>Evangelists</hi> are constituted by Christ. The third dignity in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was of the City Judges, called Presbyters or Elders: in the Church also the <hi>Presbyters</hi> follow the Apostles and Evangelists in the third place. The chief of those Judges were called Bishops or Overseers: and so in the Church the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Presbyters are the <hi>Bishops.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, They that waited upon those Judges were <hi>Deacons</hi> or Ministers: so are they called in the Church, who are Ordained below the Presbyters.</p>
                     <p>What the Office of Presbyters is in the Christian Church, the Apostles in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <note place="margin">31. The Office of Elders in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> places teach us. <hi>Paul</hi> having sent for the Presbyters of <hi>Ephesus</hi> to <hi>Miletum,</hi> gives them to understand, <hi>that they were made Overseers over the flock to feed the</hi>

<pb n="290" facs="tcp:34728:151"/> therefore, they were Pastors. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were they otherwise ordain'd, but by imposition of hands: as of <hi>Timothy</hi> it is recorded. In other places, where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any character, Presbyters are barely mention'd, to understand any other Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, but those who in so many places are most clearly describ'd, is the part of a temerarious conjector, unlesse the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text compell us to depart from the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and receiv'd signification.</p>
                     <p>In all the new Testament, only one sentence of <hi>Paul</hi> is extant, which is spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously brought to confirme those Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters non-Pastors. <hi>Let the Presbyters or</hi>

<pb n="291" facs="tcp:34728:151"/> Government should not, I say, so slightly be insinuated. Againe, the Fathers next to the Apostles times would have told us somewhat of it: at least the Greek Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who could not be ignorant of their own tongue, would have left us this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, which some suppose to follow from the very <hi>series</hi> of the words. Now, when as before the last age not one of the Interpreters hath taken the words of <hi>Paul</hi> in that sense, we have reason to see, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they admit not another interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more consonant to other places of the Scripture. Let us then consider the scope of the Apostle. He would have <hi>double honour</hi> given to Presbyters.

                        <hi>to honour</hi> is nothing else but to <hi>maintaine</hi> them <hi>honestly;</hi> for, his will is that the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows should be honour'd, who are <hi>Widows indeed,</hi> that is, as appears by the opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, such as have not believing kindred, by whose help they may be relieved; for, if they have, such he forbids to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome to the Church. After he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished his discourse of susteining Widows, he shews, the Presbyters also must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed with honest maintenance. That this is noted by the word <hi>honour,</hi> the reason
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:34728:152"/> annexed proveth: For it is written, <hi>Thou shalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corne.</hi> This same testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Scripture, he had produced else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to the same sense: <hi>who goeth a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare any time at his own charges? who plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth</hi>

                        <hi>Oxe that treadeth out the Corne.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>If we have sowen unto you spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnall things?</hi> Well is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the place, we handle, by <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome, Jerom, Ambrose, Calvin</hi> also, and <hi>Bullinger,</hi> that the Apostle here speaks of supply of maintenance, &amp; necessaries. That our Assessors should be susteined by the Churches allowance, is not seen at this time nor was ever seen. Neither is it credible, that the Apostle, who every where spares the Churches, burdened enough with poor people, would lay an unnecessary burden on them. Wherefore, if ever, in this place especially, those Assessors had been unseasonably mention'd where a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:34728:152"/> of maintenance is commenced. The words of <hi>Paul</hi> have been commodiously interpreted many wayes by others. The plainest Interpretation is, <hi>Maintenance is due indeed to all Presbyters, that rule the Church, that is, feed the Lords flock; but especially to them that wholy neglecting their private affairs, apply themselves to the only care of propagating the Gospel, and spare no labour in it.</hi> Here then, are not set down two sorts of Presbyters, but it is declared that the labour of all is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. All acknowledge, even <hi>Beza</hi> too, that the word translated, <hi>to labour,</hi> notes <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Ad Mat.</hi> 11.</note> not every labour, but that which is most painfull. In such <hi>labours</hi> not vulgar, <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 5.</note> saith, he approved himself the Minister of God; for explication whereof he addes, <hi>painfulnesse, hunger, thirst, watchings,</hi> and <note place="margin">11. 27.</note> all kinds of incommodities, Christ in his Epistle to the Bishop of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> having said, <hi>I know thy works,</hi> addeth as somewhat greater, <hi>and thy labour. Paul</hi> againe, oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times attributes to himself, <hi>to labour;</hi> and <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Apoc.</hi> 2. 2.</note> the same to certaine holy Women, which renouncing the world went up and down for the service of the Gospell. To these Presbyters then, who care for nothing but the Gospel and for its sake expose themselves to all distresses, reason it self
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:34728:153"/> will dictate, somewhat more to be due than to the rest. So also <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal.</hi>

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that clause, <hi>in the word and Doctrine,</hi> could not so well be joyned with the first part of the sentence, as the second, because it hath very fit coherence with <hi>labour,</hi> not so with <hi>rule.</hi> I will give you like forms of speech, which no man will charge with unaptnesse: <hi>Masters, that bring up youth, are profitable to the Common-wealth; they es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, that attend this one thing night and day, to make their Scholars good proficients</hi>

                     <p>Other places, that are wont to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, <note place="margin">33.

                     <p>Thus far, we have endeavoured to make it appeare, that the Adsession, we speak of,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:34728:154"/> is not by Divine precept. The fruit of which determination is, that we entertain no worse opinion of the antient Churches, than is meet, nor of the late reformed, who make no use of those Adsessors. Now, on the other side, what we conceive, may be said for that Office, shall fairly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                     <p>First, <hi>That Office might lawfully be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">34. The Highest Power, or the Church might lawfully institute lay Elders</note>
                        <hi>either by the Highest Power being Christian, or by the Church, where the Highest Power either car'd not for the Church, or granted leave to doe it.</hi> For, seeing it hath the Highest inspection over all the actions of Pastors, as the <hi>Custos</hi> of both Tables; nor can it execute all things by it self; it was lawfull to delegate some, who, in its name, might be among the Presbyters, with that right, which the Highest Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was pleased to communicate unto them. Which, by that, that shall be handled in the next Chapter shall be made more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest. The Church also is not interdicted by Divine Law, to institute Offices, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for the conservation of order, and for edification: and it hath that liberty remaining, untill it be circumscribed by some Law of the Highest Power. These things need no proof; for they shine by their own light and no Divine Law can be shewed to the contrary.</p>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:34728:154"/>
                     <p> Secondly, <hi>Some passages may be found</hi>
                        <note place="margin">35. This institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Scripture.</note>
                        <hi>in Holy Scriptures, whereby it may appeare, this institution is not displeasing unto God.</hi> I prove it, first in respect of the Highest Power, by the constitution of the Judaical Synedry: wherein, with the Priests there sate men chosen out of the people, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed truly to Civill affairs, but to Sacred too, as hath bin shew'd afore. Wherefore, when out of the new Testament, on the contrary part, nothing is alleged, hence we doe rightly collect, that Jurisdiction in Sacred things, that is, publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and joyned with command, may be committed to some of the people with the Pastors; especially if the better part be deferred to the Pastors, as in Sacred things, greater was the Authority of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. 11.</note> the Priest, then of <hi>Zebadiah</hi> the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. By the same argument, is rightly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the Ecclesiasticall Senate, which by the Commission of the Elector Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine rules the Church affairs with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and consisteth partly of Pastors, partly of pious Magistrats. In respect of the Church also, the same is thus made good. It was lawfull for the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church (even without the Apostles Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, for the Apostle reprehends the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for not doing that, which now
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:34728:155"/> he chargeth them to doe) to constitute in the Church, some to determine private controversies. If so much was lawfull to the Church for avoyding of contentions, why might not as much be lawfull for avoyding of the mischief of Oligarchy? Besides, it is oft times expedient, that the whole multitude of believers be consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in the Church affairs, as above we have shewed: why may not then the Church adjoyn some unto the Pastors, who may consider this, at what time it is needfull, that the Church be consulted. It was also lawfull for the Church, to make choice of some, who might in their <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 19 <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 22.</note> name carry and dispose of their mony; wherefore, seeing the Pastors have inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Deacons, the Church may, for this purpose joyn some associats to the Pastors, <hi>Lest any should blame them in their Administration of the Churches</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 20.</note>
                        <hi>benevolence,</hi> that I may speak with the Apostle. Lastly, it was lawfull for the Antiochian Church to delegate some out <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 2.</note> of their Company, to be present at the Debate of the Apostles and Presbytery of <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> by whose testimony they might be assured, all was there done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods word, and without par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
                     <pb n="299" facs="tcp:34728:155"/>
                     <p> Thirdly, <hi>Examples in pious Antiquity</hi>
                        <note place="margin">36. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church drawing toward it.</note>
                        <hi>are not wanting, which, if not wholy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant, yet come very near unto this custome.</hi> On the part of the Highest Powers, it is most evident, the Emperours appointed Senators and Judges, to sit in Synods, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectors and moderators of their actions. Nor this only, but to give sentence toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Bishops, concerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of a Bishop, and other matters, as we see it happen'd in the case of <hi>Photinus</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus.</hi> And, why is not that lawfull in Presbyteries, which was lawfull in Synods; especially, when as no lesse regard is to be had of Presbyteries in narrower territories, than of Synods in that amplitude of the Roman Empire? But further, by the Emperours were given unto the Churches, at their request, <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendors,</hi> which were Laiks, whose Office was to keep off all force and tumult from <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Novel.</hi> 56. <hi>Conc. Chalc can.</hi> 76.</note> the Church and Pastors; and to take care, that nothing should be done in the Church, by violence or corruption. These are they, who in the later ages begin to be called the Churches <hi>Advocates.</hi> So, by the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitans were wont to be given unto the Churches <hi>Phrontistae,</hi> or Sollicitors, who, with the Bishop should keep accounts of the Churches treasure. On the Churches
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:34728:156"/> part, we must repeat, what was said afore, that the whole multitude was not alwaies consulted, but sometimes the Elders only. Now, if it was lawfull to carry the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation from the multitude to the Elders, why might it not, the company of Elders being over great, be contracted to a fewer number, especially with consent of the multitude? Moreover in choosing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, it appears, that which was belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude was often, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promise, collated on a few. And, that in Synods Laiks were present, and gave their vote, is so manifest, both by the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Great Councill and elsewhere, that Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> could not deny it. In this point, the judgements not of <hi>Melanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thon</hi> only and the later Authors, but of <hi>Panormitan</hi> and <hi>Gerson</hi> are well known. Why, in Presbyteries may not be allowed as much to Laiks, chosen for that purpose, no reason can be found. But farther yet: It is apparent, in the antient Church, there were Matrons, to exhort the other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to an honest conversation: whom they called <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and, because in the Churches they sate above the other women, <hi>Presidents.</hi> The XI. Canon of the Laodicean Synod abrogated them, when they had continued untill that time,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:34728:156"/> as <hi>Balsamon</hi> notes. And haply, <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of them, where he requires the <hi>Presbytes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 3.</note> or aged women <hi>to be holy in behaviour, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things: That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</hi> &amp;c. If women therefore, partakers of no Church-Office, might neverthelesse be appointed by the Church, to be <hi>teachers</hi> of other women, why might not others, beside the Pastors be assumed by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who, abstaining from Pastorall Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, should with greater dilligence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that, that is not only permitted, but commanded every Christian? And, if those were entitled <hi>Presbytesses,</hi> we may also in a more generall respect, give unto these the appellation of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, <note place="margin">37. The English Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens not much unlike the Adsessors.</note> not much distant from the Office of Adsessors, is the Office of Church War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens and Sidemen in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Upon whom it resteth, to take care, that none disturbe the Divine service; that no excommunicate person thrust him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Assembly; They are also to admonish inordinate livers, and, if they persevere, to defer their names unto the Bishop. And these are chosen by the Church.</p>
                     <pb n="302" facs="tcp:34728:157"/>
                     <p> Fourthly, our last position is, <hi>that from</hi>
                        <note place="margin">38. The Adsessors be of good use.</note>
                        <hi>these Assessors no small benefit may accrew unto the Church.</hi> For, if we respect the Highest Powers, it is expedient for them to have, in the Assemblies of Pastors, their eyes and ears, by whose Ministry they may explore, whether all things be done with fidelity and according to rule. But, if we look upon the Churches, it is a thing of consequence, that they also have a good opinion of the Pastors; which will then most probably come to passe, when they have witnesses of their actions, and some to beget and keep a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding between the Pastors and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
                     <p>Upon the premises it follows, that in the Office of Adsessors, who in some places are in use, whom for distinction we may call temporary or <hi>Lay-Presbyters,</hi> there is nothing to be reprehended. But, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, these <hi>cautions</hi> are to be remembred. <note place="margin">39. Yet with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> 1. <hi>That the Office be not affirmed of Divine precept;</hi> which cannot be said without contumely of the antient Church, and divulsion of the present. 2. <hi>That nothing be attributed to them, which pertains to the Evangelicall Keys;</hi> which Christ having given to be exercis'd by Pastors only, may not be by us transferr'd to any other. To
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:34728:157"/> excommunication therefore, as it is the Pastors work, they can conferre nothing beside their Counsel; but, as excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is also the work of the people, who ought to remove from them wicked per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, so far they may make an Act, or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi> which may be propos'd to the people for their approbation. 3. <hi>Let none be elected to this adsession, who are unable for Church-Government, and especially for judging controversies.</hi> For that is perillous, and undecent for the Church, and the most ready way to <hi>Oligarchy.</hi> 4. <hi>Let not those Adsessors exercise any externall Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Coactive Power, beyond what the publick Laws allow them.</hi> 5. <hi>Let them know their Office, not only as the Pastors Office, which is instituted by Christ; but, as the things that are of humane Institution, and therefore mutable; is subject to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Highest Powers.</hi> The two last cautions being not known, or not well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, great perturbations of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth doe necessarily follow, as wise men have heretofore admonished, and we have daily experience. For, many men having once imbibed this opinion, that, that Government is of Right Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, come at last to this, to believe the Highest Powers have little or nothing to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:34728:158"/> doe in the Church, as being by God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly provided both with Pastors and with Rulers too. Thus is an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane prudence confronted to the Ordinance of God, and in this two headed Empire is sowen perpetuall seed of parties and factions: whereunto they cease not to turne their eyes, whosoever either in State or Church seek after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations. They that remember, what hath been done, thirty years since, in this our Country, know the truth of what I say. And this consideration principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mov'd me, not to leave this question untoucht. 'Tis worthy the Relation, <note place="margin">40. The Genevian election of Adses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors.</note> that in <hi>Geneva</hi> (which City brought forth, if not first this Synedry it self, at least the prime Defenders of it:) the entire right of electing those Elders is in the City Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which is call'd the <hi>Little,</hi> the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the Pastors being only heard. Nor are they only elected by the Senators, but from among Senators alone, that is two out of the same little Senate, and ten both out of the Senate of the sixty, and out of the other Senate of two hundred. The election made after this manner, is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the examination of the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: and the Elders elected, although they have no Jurisdiction, yet they give
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:34728:158"/> oath to the Republick. He must needs be very ill-sighted, who perceives not, what incommodities the <hi>Genevians</hi> feared, when they took such a sollicitous and wary course for their elections.</p>

Liberry of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated sometimes</note> are these: <hi>the choice of Religion,</hi> and as well the Election, as the Deposition of the chiefe Pastors: which the Highest Powers, for the most part, have reserved to themselves, yet not alwaies. For also to certaine subjects, whether Princes, or Corporations, we see the choice of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion hath been granted, when the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of the times exacted it. Nor is
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:34728:159"/> this so new, when the Persians also, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians and Romans granted the Jews and other Nations, under their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Liberty of Religion: Moreover, the Bishops of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Constantinople,</hi> we know, were not alwaies elected by the Emperors.</p>
                     <p>The ways of committing Right to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <note place="margin">4. Vicars are either substitutes or dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</note> are two, <hi>Substitution,</hi> and <hi>Delegation.</hi> Substitution I call a mandate given by Law or Privilege: Delegation, by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Grant. That the Highest Powers were accustomed to substitute Bishops, we have shew'd above; for thence ariseth, <note place="margin">5. Bishops substitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Cleriks.</note> the right of making Canons, which have the force of Law; the right with Power to depose a Pastor, or to exclude one of the people out of the Congregation: which apparently have been permitted to Synods or Presbyteries. From the same Spring-head is the right of the Clergy or Chapters to make elections: as may be proved by many Patents of Emperours and Kings. Wherein verily, their piety is worthy of all honour. For they judged, that unto them, who were most acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Sacred affairs, and to whom the Pastorall Regiment was by God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that other Regiment, which flows from the Imperiall Power, might also be
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:34728:160"/> committed most safely. Would the event had not oft deceiv'd them, in their so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable design. In the mean time, they, who endure not Pastors to be call'd, in any part, Vicars of the Highest Powers, are to advised to depose their errour, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved either by reason, or the Authority of Laws and Histories. Elsewhere we see, <note place="margin">6. Pastors and Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> the care of holy things was committed to Pastors with others, not Pastors, but pious and learned men, and that not without example of Divine Authority. For the great Synedry of LXX. among the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, upon whom, among other things, the care of Religion lay, consisted of Priests, Levits, and men chosen out of the people. No doubt, in matters of Religion, (yea in all Judgements, if I mistake not) the High Priest gave his sentence before the rest. Yet so, that the Kings Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, who was entitled <hi>Nasi,</hi> had the first place, and asked the Votes. After which exemplar, I observe, the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Senate is compos'd in the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. This Conjunction of the lesser Powers with the Bishops I find also in <hi>Justinian.</hi> Certaine it is, in the Deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Nov.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> of Bishops, the judgements of the Synod, and of the Synators or Judges ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Emperours, met together.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:34728:160"/> So, <hi>Pholinus</hi> is deposed by the sentence of the Bishop, and the men of Senators rank, whose names are recorded in <hi>Epiphanius.</hi> Sometimes therefore, the lesser Powers were associated to the Pastors, only to suppresse violence and tumult; sometimes, to give sentence with them. And so, in the election of Bishops, <hi>Justinians</hi> Law united with the Clergy, the City Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates. Which manner had not its first Originall then; for <hi>Theodoret</hi> tels us, <hi>After the death of</hi> Athanasius, Peter <hi>was made Bishop by the suffrages of the Clergy, and of the men in dignity and office.</hi> Yea, times have so fallen out, that, by reason of Schisms or the tumour of Bishops, it was necessary, this weighty part, the care of Sacred things with command, should be committed to the inferiour Powers, and <note place="margin">7. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alone</note> that without the Bishops. For, <hi>Aelianus Constantin's</hi> Proconsul, and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> by Commission of <hi>Honorius,</hi> examin'd the Laws of the Donatists, and gave sentence 'twixt the parties, as above is noted. And in the Court of C P. one of the Patricians did particularly attend the Church affairs: whence his Office had its name. So also, the Parliaments of <hi>France</hi> by appeal, the Senate of <hi>Spain</hi> by way of opposition, the Court of <hi>Holland</hi> by penall writs, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:34728:161"/> the errours of the Ecclesiastic cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, that the right of electing or <note place="margin">8. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And this is the <hi>Right of Patronage,</hi> which, not with us only, is in force, but in <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> as may be seen in the English Canons and the Palatine Constitutions. Now, as we doe not blame their piety, who are sollicitous, lest any mischief be done the Church, under colour of this right; so the truth exacteth at our hands, not to let passe in silence the temerarious Assertion of those men, who say this right is a new thing, and depends upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Pope. Surely, <hi>Justinian</hi> is not a new Emperour, nor liv'd he under the Popes Domination, yet hath he establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed this Right by a Law. <hi>If any devout per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>

And in the year DLIII. a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non was made is the Councill of <hi>Tolen,</hi> to the same effect. About the yeare DCCCXXVII. were collected the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great, wherein we find, <hi>If Laic (Patrons) present unto the Bishops Cleriks approved both for their life and learning to be consecrated, and consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted in their Churches, by no means let them be rejected.</hi> Not only Pastors of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior degree, but Bishops also were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted by the Dukes of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Saxonia,</hi> by a Right long since derived from the German Emperours, as hath been observ'd by others. When as, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out such Grant, the Investiture of Bishops (as <hi>Hermoldus</hi> of old hath written) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the Imperiall Majestie. Wherefore this Right was extracted from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:34728:162"/> and Concession of Emperors and Kings, and is an Of-spring flowing from the Right of the Highest Power. And it is so far from depending on the Popes Authority, that on the contrary, the makers and Interpreters of the Papall Law, have opposed or clipped nothing more eagerly, desiring to perswade the world, that all benefices are the Patrimony of the Pope. <note place="margin">9.

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:34728:163"/> therefore, the Pope fearing he should not be obeyed, added to his decree the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Custome; which many as it now appears, if they had a Papacy, would not adde. That our States abrogated the Right of Patronage, neither is true, nor can be said without their injury. For they mention, among the causes of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the Acts of the Trent Synod; and shew, that nothing did more hinder the publication of them, than that the Lay-Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons complained, their Right was infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by those Constitutions. What opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion the States themselves had of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse, we have heard their own words. This is a certain truth, that both the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction made by the Patrons may, upon just <note place="margin">11.

To which restraint, if we adde both the exploration of the people, and the Pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Ordination, the corruption of the Church need no more be feared, from Noble Patrons, than from R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Two things remaine to be spoken, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I conclude this part, concerning de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Right. The one is this, <hi>that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour</hi>
                        <pb n="315" facs="tcp:34728:163"/>
                        <hi>powers have, by Divine Right, no Authority at all about Sacred things.</hi> What ere they have, they have it as <hi>by the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,</hi> which we have elswhere noted. Wherefore, neither <hi>Joseph</hi> the <hi>Decurion,</hi> nor the Proconsull <hi>Sergius,</hi> could doe more in the Church, than any private person. Because, neither the former from the great Synedry, nor the later from the Roman Emperour, had received any Power, to dispose of Ecclesiasticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And no man ought to snatch to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the sword, or any part thereof. The other is this: <hi>Being the tuition of the Church</hi>
                        <note place="margin">13. And little is to be given them by the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred things.</note>
                        <hi>is a principall part of the Supreme Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the Highest Powers will doe wisely, if they grant as little as may be of it to the Magistrats.</hi> And whatsoever they grant, let them take care at least, to commend these most noble Offices, only to their most noble Peers. For, if the charge of Checker mony and Coine is committed not to the Municipall Judges, but to men of higher place, how much more doth it concerne the publick safety, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches honour, that Ecclesiasticall affairs be not devolved to inferior tribunals. So, in <hi>France,</hi> no Judges below the Parliament have cognizance of abuses of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastic censure; nor with us, of old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:34728:164"/> the Senate of <hi>Holland.</hi> But, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection <note place="margin">14. None at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse they be Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox.</note> of the Church affairs is not easily to be deferr'd to them, who are not in the Churches books. For, seeing both Jews and Christians held it irreligious, to carry their private complaints before such as were Aliens to their Law; much more unworthy were it and dishonourable, in so great frequency of Right believers, that the wounds of the Church should be committed to the cure of any other persons, but only to the Sons of the Church.</p>

                  <p>IF it be objected (as a friend of mine conjectured it might) that the work is any way opposite to the present Government, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king so much of Kings and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: The answer is, That the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Author distinguisheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Kings absolute, and such as are confind or bound up by Laws; and cannot act without or against a Parliament. See cap. 3. Sect. 8. So that, This treatise doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to dispute the States Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ('tis ill disputing with those that command Legions:) but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing
<pb facs="tcp:34728:174"/> that, humbly shews them, what they may and ought to doe, on behalf of the Church. And, in the very first page, you find all the Book is written of the Highest power, whether King or Senate. And, these are the Authors words at the end of 15. Sect. Chap. 11. A Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate without a King, is as it were a King. This I thought fit to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise, to prevent jealousy. Fare you well, And remember, 'tis one of the best pieces of the excellent <hi>Grotius.</hi>
